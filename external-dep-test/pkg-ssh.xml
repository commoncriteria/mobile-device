  <project-notes>
   This update turns the SSH Extended Package into a Functional Package. 
   This branch incorporates the CCUF version of the SSH FP into the NIAP version.

   Significant changes:

	- Removed FCS_COP and required that the PP or PP-Module that includes the package support the required algorithms. This effectively 
		eliminated the need for TD0240.
	- Incorporated TD0331
	- Incorporated TD0332
	- Incorporated TD0420
	- Incorporated TD0446
	- Added audit events covering those specified in NDcPP and a couple of the ESM PPs. These are presented as optional, and can be
		incorporated by selection in a PP or PP-module that includes this package. (TLS should do this too).

        <h:p>
	    Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services over
	    an untrusted network. SSH software can act as a client, server, or both.
      	</h:p><h:p>
		This <h:i>Functional Package (FP) for Secure Shell</h:i> provides a collection of SSH protocol related 
      		Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) and 
		Evaluation Activities (EAs) covering audit, authentication, cryptographic algorithms, and protocol negotiation. The intent 
		of this package is to provide Protection Profile (PP), collaborative Protection Profile (cPP), and Protection Profile Module (PP-Module) authors with a readily consumable collection of SFRs and EAs to be integrated into
		their documents.  
        </h:p><h:p>
        	The functional components defined for this package were chosen to ensure that a conformant TOE implements SSH in a secure manner by requiring
        	that the TSF implement protocol-specific details that are not captured in the FTP_PRO SFR family. 
        </h:p>
