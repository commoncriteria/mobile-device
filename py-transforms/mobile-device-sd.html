    in general they also help developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id="structure-"><span class="ctr">1.2</span> Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
        which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation, then
        the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
        In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
        may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
        but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
        completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
        the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
        To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
        completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
        Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
        </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of assurance components, if the Evaluation 
        Activities for an assurance component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
        Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
        that the verdict for the assurance component is a ‘pass’.
        To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the assurance component when these Evaluation 
        Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
        from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

        For findings regarding the TSS section, the evaluator’s verdicts will be 
        associated with the CEM workunit ASE_TSS.1-1.
        Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be 
        associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, 
        since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the PP.</p><p>For ensuring the guidance documentation provides 
        sufficient information for 
        the administrators/users as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator’s verdicts will 
        be associated with CEM workunits ADV_FSP.1-7, AGD_OPE.1-4, and AGD_OPE.1-5.</p><p>Finally, the subsection labeled Tests is where 
        the authors have determined 
        that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary.
        While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where 
        it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the 
        developer may have existing tests. 
        Therefore, it is acceptable for the evaluator to witness developer-generated 
        tests in lieu of executing the tests. 
        In this case, the evaluator must ensure the developer’s tests are executing both 
        in the manner declared by the developer and as mandated by the EA.

                implementation of RSA Key Generation by the TOE using the Key Generation test. This
                test verifies the ability of the TSF to correctly produce values for the key
                components including the public verification exponent <i>e</i>, the private

                The evaluator shall verify the implementation of the key
                establishment schemes supported by the TOE using the applicable tests below. <br/><br/>
                <h3>SP800-56A Revision 3 Key Establishment Schemes</h3>
                The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of SP800-56A
                Revision 3 key establishment schemes using the following Function and Validity
                tests. These validation tests for each key agreement scheme verify that a TOE has
                implemented the components of the key agreement scheme according to the
                specifications in the Recommendation. These components include the calculation of
                the DLC primitives (the shared secret value Z) and the calculation of the derived
                keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function (KDF). If key confirmation is
                supported, the evaluator shall also verify that the components of key confirmation
                have been implemented correctly, using the test procedures described below. This
                includes the parsing of the DKM, the generation of MACdata and the calculation of
                MacTag. <br/><br/>
                <i><b>Function Test</b></i>
                <br/><br/> The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement
                the key agreement schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall
                generate or obtain test vectors from a known good implementation of the TOE
                supported schemes. For each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role
                combination, KDF type, and, if supported, key confirmation role- key confirmation
                type combination, the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. The data set
                consists of one set of domain parameter values (FFC) or the NIST approved curve
                (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending
                on the scheme being tested. <br/><br/> The evaluator shall obtain the DKM,
                the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static and/or ephemeral), the MAC tag(s), and
                any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other Information field OI and TOE id
                fields. <br/><br/> If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A
                Revision 3, the evaluator shall obtain only the public keys and the hashed value of
                the shared secret. <br/><br/> The evaluator shall verify the correctness of
                the TSF’s implementation of a given scheme by using a known good implementation to
                calculate the shared secret value, derive the keying material DKM, and compare
                hashes or MAC tags generated from these values.<br/><br/> If key
                confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each implemented
                approved MAC algorithm. <br/><br/>
                <i><b>Validity Test</b></i>
                <br/><br/> The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize
                another party’s valid and invalid key agreement results with or without key
                confirmation. To conduct this test, the evaluator shall obtain a list of the
                supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A Revision 3 key
                agreement implementation to determine which errors the TOE should be able to
                recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24 (FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors
                consisting of data sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves,
                the evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s public/private key pairs, MacTag, and any
                inputs used in the KDF, such as the other info and TOE id fields. <br/><br/>
                The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE
                recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being
                incorrect: the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the
                data to be MACed, or the generated MacTag. If the TOE contains the full or partial
                (only ECC) public key validation, the evaluator will also individually inject errors
                in both parties’ static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the
                TOE’s static private key to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key
                validation function and/or the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At
                least two of the test vectors shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in
                valid key agreement results (they should pass). <br/><br/> The TOE shall use
                these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme using the
                corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results with the
                results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects these
                errors. <br/><br/>
                <h3>SP800-56B Key Establishment Schemes</h3> The evaluator shall verify that
                the TSS describes whether the TOE acts as a sender, a recipient, or both for
                RSA-based key establishment schemes. <br/><br/> If the TOE acts as a sender,
                the following evaluation activity shall be performed to ensure the proper operation
                of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based key establishment scheme: <br/>
                To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a
                known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
                supported key establishment scheme and its options (with or without key confirmation
                if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key confirmation
                is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is
                supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test vector
                shall include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any additional
                input parameters if applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key confirmation is
                incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the evaluator
                shall perform a key establishment encryption operation on the TOE with the same
                inputs (in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the test shall use the
                MacKey from the test vector instead of the randomly generated MacKey used in normal
                operation) and ensure that the outputted ciphertext is equivalent to the ciphertext
                in the test vector. <br/><br/> If the TOE acts as a receiver, the following
                evaluation activities shall be performed to ensure the proper operation of every TOE
                supported combination of RSA-based key establishment scheme: <br/> To conduct
                this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors FCS_CKM.2.1/LOCKED from a
                known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
                supported key establishment scheme and its options (with our without key
                confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key
                confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if
                KTS-OAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test
                vector shall include the RSA private key, the plaintext keying material (KeyData),
                any additional input parameters if applicable, the MacTag in cases where key
                confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector,
                the evaluator shall perform the key establishment decryption operation on the TOE
                and ensure that the outputted plaintext keying material (KeyData) is equivalent to
                the plaintext keying material in the test vector. In cases where key confirmation is
                incorporated, the evaluator shall perform the key confirmation steps and ensure that
                the outputted MacTag is equivalent to the MacTag in the test vector.
                <br/><br/> The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the TOE
                handles decryption errors. In accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-56B, the
                TOE must not reveal the particular error that occurred, either through the contents
                of any outputted or logged error message or through timing variations. If KTS-OAEP
                is supported, the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext values that
                trigger each of the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special
                Publication 800-56B section 7.2.2.3, ensure that each decryption attempt results in
                an error, and ensure that any outputted or logged error message is identical for

                <b>Curve25519 Key Establishment Schemes</b><br/><br/> The evaluator
                shall verify a TOE's implementation of the key agreement scheme using the following
                Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for each key agreement scheme
                verify that a TOE has implemented the components of the key agreement scheme
                according to the specification. These components include the calculation of the
                shared secret K and the hash of K. <br/><br/>
                <b>Function Test</b><br/><br/> The Function test verifies the
                ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement schemes correctly. To conduct this
                test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known good
                implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each supported key agreement role
                and hash function combination, the tester shall generate 10 sets of public keys.
                These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being tested.
                <br/><br/> The evaluator shall obtain the shared secret value K, and the
                hash of K.<br/><br/> The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s
                implementation of a given scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate
                the shared secret value K and compare the hash generated from this value. <br/><br/>
                <b> Validity Test</b><br/><br/> The Validity test verifies the
                ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid and invalid key agreement
                results. To conduct this test, the evaluator generates a set of 30 test vectors
                consisting of data sets including the evaluator’s public keys and the TOE’s
                public/private key pairs. <br/><br/> The evaluator shall inject an error in
                some of the test vectors to test that the TOE recognizes invalid key agreement
                results caused by the following fields being incorrect: the shared secret value K or
                the hash of K. At least two of the test vectors shall remain unmodified and
                therefore should result in valid key agreement results (they should pass).
                <br/><br/> The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key
                agreement scheme using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the
                TOE’s results with the results using a known good implementation verifying that the
                TOE detects these errors. <br/><br/>

                of a REK describes how any reading, import, and export of that REK is prevented.
                (For example, if the hardware protecting the REK is removable, the description
                should include how other devices are prevented from reading the REK.) The evaluator
                shall verify that the TSS describes how encryption/decryption/derivation actions are
                isolated so as to prevent applications and system-level processes from reading the
                REK while allowing encryption/decryption/derivation by the key.<br/><br/>
                The evaluator shall verify that the description includes how the OS is

                allowed access to the REK, how any other software in the execution environment is
                prevented from reading that key material, and what other mechanisms prevent the REK
                key material from being written to shared memory locations between the OS and
                the separate execution environment. <br/><br/> If key derivation is
                performed using a REK, the evaluator shall ensure that the TSS description includes
                a description of the key derivation function and shall verify the key derivation
                uses an approved derivation mode and key expansion algorithm according to

                    is selected, the evaluator shall ensure the TSS includes a description of the

                    tool, and save the session data. <br/><br/> Step 2: The evaluator shall
                    configure an IPsec VPN client that supports the routing specified in this
                    requirement, and if necessary, configure the device to perform the routing
                    specified as described in the AGD guidance. The evaluator shall turn on the
                    sniffing tool, establish the VPN connection, and perform the same actions with
                    the device as performed in the first step. The evaluator shall verify that the
                    sniffing tool captures traffic generated by these actions, turn off the sniffing
                    tool, and save the session data. <br/><br/> Step 3: The evaluator shall
                    examine the traffic from both step one and step two to verify that all Data
                    Plane traffic is encapsulated by IPsec. The evaluator shall examine the Security
                    Parameter Index (SPI) value present in the encapsulated packets captured in Step
                    two from the TOE to the Gateway and shall verify this value is the same for all
                    actions used to generate traffic through the VPN. Note that it is expected that
                    the SPI value for packets from the Gateway to the TOE is different than the SPI
                    value for packets from the TOE to the Gateway. The evaluator shall be aware that
                    IP traffic on the cellular baseband outside of the IPsec tunnel may be emanating
                    from the baseband processor and shall verify with the manufacturer that any
                    identified traffic is not emanating from the application processor.
                    <br/><br/> Step 4: The evaluator shall perform an ICMP echo from the TOE
                    to the IP address of another device on the local wireless network and shall
                    verify that no packets are sent using the sniffing tool. The evaluator shall
                    attempt to send packets to the TOE outside the VPN tunnel (i.e. not through the
                    VPN gateway), including from the local wireless network, and shall verify that
                    the TOE discards them. </li></ul>

                  in the boot sequence the radios are powered on and indicates if the radios are used 
                  as part of the initialization of the device.

		  The
                  evaluator shall ensure that minimal signal leakage enters the RF shielded
                  enclosure (i.e. Faraday bag, Faraday box, RF shielded room) by performing the
                  following steps:<br/><br/> Step 1: Place the antenna of the spectrum
                  analyzer inside the RF shielded enclosure.<br/><br/> Step 2: Enable "Max
                  Hold" on the spectrum analyzer and perform a spectrum sweep of the frequency range
                  between 300 MHz – 6000 MHz, in I kHz steps (this range should encompass 802.11,
                  802.15, GSM, UMTS, and LTE). This range will not address NFC 13.56.MHz, another

		  Function <span href="#mf-radios"> <span data-target="mf-radios" class="dynref">4</span></span>.

		  The evaluator shall exercise the TSF configuration as the administrator and,
                    if not restricted to the administrator, the user, to enable and disable the
                    state of each radio (e.g. Wi-Fi, cellular, NFC, Bluetooth). Additionally,
                    the evaluator shall repeat the steps below, booting into any auxiliary boot mode
                    supported by the device. For each radio, the evaluator shall:<br/><br/>
                    Step 1: Place the antenna of the spectrum analyzer inside the RF shielded
                    enclosure. Configure the spectrum analyzer to sweep desired frequency range for
                    the radio to be tested (based on range provided in the TSS)). The ambient noise
                    floor shall be set to -110 dBm. Place the TOE into the RF shielded enclosure to
                    isolate them from all other RF traffic. <br/><br/> Step 2: The evaluator
                    shall create a baseline of the expected behavior of RF signals. The evaluator
                    shall power on the device, ensure the radio in question is enabled, power off
                    the device, enable "Max Hold" on the spectrum analyzer and power on the device.
                    The evaluator shall wait 2 minutes at each Authentication Factor interface prior
                    to entering the necessary password to complete the boot process, waiting 5
                    minutes after the device is fully booted. The evaluator shall observe that RF
                    spikes are present at the expected uplink channel frequency. The evaluator shall
                    clear the "Max Hold" on the spectrum analyzer. <br/><br/> Step 3: The
                    evaluator shall verify the absence of RF activity for the uplink channel when
                    the radio in question is disabled. The evaluator shall complete the following
                    test five times. The evaluator shall power on the device, ensure the radio in
                    question is disabled, power off the device, enable "Max Hold" on the spectrum
                    analyzer and power on the device. The evaluator shall wait 2 minutes at each
                    Authentication Factor interface prior to entering the necessary password to
                    complete the boot process, waiting 5 minutes after the device is fully booted.
                    The evaluator shall clear the "Max Hold" on the spectrum analyzer. If the radios 
                    are used for device initialization, then a spike of RF activity for the uplink channel
                    can be observed initially at device boot. However, if a spike of
                    RF activity for the uplink channel of the specific radio frequency band is
                    observed after the device is fully booted or at an Authentication Factor interface 
                    it is deemed that the radio is enabled.

        Section 2 (Evaluation Activities for SFRs), Section 3 (Evaluation Activities
        for Optional Requirements), and Section 4 (Evaluation Activities for
        Selection-Based Requirements) are an interpretation of the more general CEM

        TOE.</p><p>In this section, each SAR that is contained in the cPP is listed, and the EAs
        that are not associated with an SFR are captured here, or a reference is made
        to the CEM, and the evaluator is expected to perform the CEM work units.
