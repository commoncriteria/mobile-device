  <ns1:Introduction>
    <ns0:section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">
      The scope of the Bluetooth PP-Module is to describe the security functionality of Bluetooth technology in terms of [CC] 
      and to define functional and assurance requirements for the Bluetooth capability of mobile devices and operating systems.
      Bluetooth is a communications standard for short-range wireless transmissions. 
      Bluetooth is implemented in many commercial devices as a method for wirelessly connecting devices or accessories.
      This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PPs: <html:ul>
        <html:li>General Purpose Operating System (GPOS) Protection Profile, Version 4.2.1</html:li>
        <html:li>Mobile Device Fundamentals (MDF) Protection Profile, Version 3.2</html:li>
      </html:ul>
      <html:p /> These Base-PPs are valid because consumer-grade desktop and mobile devices may both have Bluetooth hardware radios and so both desktop and mobile operating systems have the 
      software/firmware capability to allow products to use them.

    <ns0:section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
     
     The Target of Evaluation (TOE) in this PP-Module is a product that implements Bluetooth functionality.
      This PP-Module describes the extended security functionality of Bluetooth in terms of CC. This PP-Module extends the Protection Profile for General Purpose Operating Systems or Mobile Device Fundamentals. 
      A compliant TOE will meet all mandatory SFRs defined in this PP-Module in addition to the mandatory SFRs of its claimed Base-PP. For each Base-PP, this PP-Module refines several of the Base-PP's SFRs so that they can accommodate the
      Bluetooth functionality defined by the PP-Module. A compliant TOE will claim all selection-based SFRs from this PP-Module and its Base-PP as needed based on the relevant selections in other requirements being chosen.
      <html:p />
      Note that <ns0:xref to="bibMDF" /> evaluation activities require certain tests to be performed against all radios present on the device. When the TOE also claims conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes 
      this PP-Module, those tests are executed against the Bluetooth radio as well.
      <html:p />
      Also note that each Base-PP defines its own requirements for protection of data at rest. When the TOE also claims conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes this PP-Module, 
      any data that is used by the TOE's Bluetooth implementation is expected to be stored using the same protection mechanisms.

      
      <ns0:section title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
        The Bluetooth implementation is a logical component executing on an end user personal computing or mobile device. As such, the TOE must rely heavily on the TOE's operational environment (host platform,
        network stack, and operating system) for its execution domain and its proper usage. The TOE
        will rely on the IT environment to address much of the security functionality related to
        administrative functions. The physical boundary of the TOE includes the physical device on which it is installed, as this device will contain an internal or external Bluetooth radio that is used as the physical medium for 
        transmitting and receiving data over the Bluetooth logical channel.

      address the security problems in at least the following use cases. These use cases are intentionally
      very broad, as many specific use cases exist within these larger categories.

          <ns0:description>
            This use case is for a Bluetooth TOE that is part of a general-purpose operating system. Specifically, the Bluetooth TOE is expected to be part of the operating system itself and not a standalone third-party application that 
            is installed on top of it.

            This use case is for a Bluetooth TOE that is part of a mobile operating system that runs on a mobile device. Specifically, the Bluetooth TOE is expected to be part of the mobile operating system itself and not

  <ns1:spd title="Security Problem Description">
    All threats, assumptions, organizational security policies, and/or objectives that apply to this PP-Module are inherited from the Base-PP to which the TOE also conforms. 
    This PP-Module does not add or remove any elements to the security problem definition given in the Base-PP. 
    The SFRs defined in this PP-Module provide additional mechanisms for mitigating the threats already defined in the Base-PPs due to the fact that including a 
    Bluetooth implementation introduces a new external interface to the underlying general-purpose OS or mobile device platform.
    
    
    <ns1:Threats>
        This PP-Module defines no additional threats beyond those defined in the base PPs. Note however that the

                (BT-8. optional) The Bluetooth services and/or profiles that may be disabled should be listed for the user or administrator either by service and/or profile name or by the types of applications for which the service and/or profile is used.<html:p />

              FIA_BLT_EXT.7 differs from FIA_BLT_EXT.6 because a conformant TOE may distinguish between "trusted" and "untrusted" devices 
              such that the TSF grants "untrusted" devices access to fewer services following pairing. 
              However, this behavior is not required; if the TSF does not treat "trusted" and "untrusted" devices any differently, 
              the ST author may complete the assignments in FIA_BLT_EXT.6.1 and FIA_BLT_EXT.7.1 with lists of Bluetooth profiles.

                If it does not, then the test evaluation activities for FIA_BLT_EXT.6 are sufficient to satisfy this component.

                  <ns0:test>While the service is in active use by an application on the TOE, the evaluator shall attempt to gain access to a "protected" Bluetooth service (as specified in the assignment in FIA_BLT_EXT.7.1) 
                    from an "untrusted" remote device. 
                    The evaluator shall verify that the user is explicitly asked for authorization by the TOE to allow access to the service for the particular remote device. 
                    The evaluator shall deny the authorization on the TOE and verify that the remote attempt to access the service fails due to lack of authorization.</ns0:test>
                  <ns0:test>The evaluator shall repeat Test 1, this time allowing the authorization and verifying that the remote device successfully accesses the service.</ns0:test>
                  <ns0:test>(conditional): If there exist any services that require explicit user authorization for access by untrusted devices but not by trusted devices 
                    (i.e. a service that is listed in FIA_BLT_EXT.7.1 but not FIA_BLT_EXT.6.1), 
                    the evaluator shall repeat Test 1 for these services and observe that the results are identical. 
                    That is, the evaluator shall use these results to verify that explicit user approval is required for an untrusted device to access these services, 
                    and failure to grant this approval will result in the device being unable to access them.</ns0:test>
                  <ns0:test>(conditional): If test 3 applies, the evaluator shall repeat Test 2 using any services chosen in Test 3 and observe that the results are identical. 
                    That is, the evaluator shall use these results to verify that explicit user approval is required for an untrusted device to access these services, 
                    and granting this approval will result in the device being able to access them.</ns0:test>
                  <ns0:test>(conditional): If test 3 applies, the evaluator shall repeat Test 3 except this time designating the device as "trusted" prior to attempting to access the service. 
                    The evaluator shall verify that access to the service is granted without explicit user authorization 
                    (because the device is now trusted and therefore FIA_BLT_EXT.7.1 no longer applies to it). 
                    That is, the evaluator shall use these results to demonstrate that the TSF will grant a device access to different services depending on whether or not the device is trusted.</ns0:test>

  <ns0:appendix title="Optional Requirements" id="optional"> As indicated in <ns0:xref to="ccl" />,
    the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the TOE are
    contained in the body of this PP. Additionally, there are three other types of requirements
    specified in <ns0:xref to="optional" />, <ns0:xref to="sel-based" />, and <ns0:xref to="objective" />. The first type (in this appendix) are requirements that can be included
    in the <ns0:xref to="ST" />, but are not required in order for a TOE to claim conformance to
    this PP-Module. The second type (in <ns0:xref to="sel-based" />) are requirements based on selections
    in the body of the PP-Module: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements in that
    appendix must be included. The third type (in <ns0:xref to="objective" /> are components that
    are not required in order to conform to this PP-Module, but will be included in the baseline
    requirements in future versions of this PP-Module, so adoption by vendors is encouraged. </ns0:appendix>

  
  <ns0:appendix title="Selection-Based Requirements" id="sel-based"> As indicated in the introduction to
    this PP-Module, the baseline requirements are contained in the body of this PP-Module. There are additional requirements based on
    selections in the body of the PP-Module: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements
    below will need to be included. 
  </ns0:appendix>

  
  <ns0:appendix title="Objective Requirements" id="objective"> This appendix includes requirements that
    specify security functionality which also addresses threats. The requirements are not currently
    mandated in the body of this PP-Module as they describe security functionality not yet widely available
    in commercial technology. However, these requirements may be included in the ST such that the
    TOE is still conformant to this PP-Module, and it is expected that they be included as soon as
    possible. </ns0:appendix>


  
  
  <ns0:appendix title="Implicitly Satisfied Requirements" id="satisfiedreqs">
    This appendix lists requirements that should be considered satisfied by products successfully evaluated against this PP-Module. 
    However, these requirements are not featured explicitly as SFRs and should not be included in the ST. 
    They are not included as standalone SFRs because it would increase the time, cost, and complexity of evaluation. This approach is permitted by [CC] Part 1, 8.2 Dependencies between components.<html:p />
    This information benefits systems engineering activities which call for inclusion of particular security controls. Evaluation against the PP-Module provides evidence that these controls are present and have been evaluated.

        <html:td>FCS_CKM.1 - Cryptographic Key Generation</html:td>
        <html:td>FCS_CKM_EXT.8 has a dependency on FCS_CKM.1 for the generation of ECDH key pairs. This dependency is implicitly satisfied in this PP-Module because both Base-PPs the PP-Module is intended to extend
        define this SFR and specify ECDH key generation as a required capability of the TOE. Therefore, a conformant TOE will always have this capability.</html:td>

        <html:td>FPT_STM.1 - Reliable Time Stamps</html:td>
        <html:td>FCS_CKM_EXT.8 has a dependency on FPT_STM.1 because key generation may be triggered by a given time period elapsing. When the TOE claims conformance to <ns0:xref to="bibMDF" />,
        this dependency is satisfied explicitly through the Base-PP's definition of FPT_STM.1. When the TOE claims conformance to <ns0:xref to="bibGPOS" />, this dependency is satisfied implicitly through that
        PP's A.PLATFORM assumption of a trustworthy computing platform, which can be reasonably assumed to include a hardware real-time clock.</html:td>
