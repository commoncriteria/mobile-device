    <><span style="color: black;">The scope of this Protection Profile (</span><:a href="https://www.niap-ccevs.org/MMO/PP/MDF%203.3%20PP/#abbr_PP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">PP</:a><span style="color: black;">) is to describe the security functionality of mobile devices in terms of [</span><:a href="https://www.niap-ccevs.org/MMO/PP/MDF%203.3%20PP/#abbr_CC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">CC</:a><span style="color: black;">] and to define functional and assurance requirements for such devices.</span></>
    <tech-terms/>
    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription"><span style="color: black;">This assurance standard specifies information security requirements for Mobile Devices for use in an enterprise. A Mobile Device in the context of this assurance standard is a device, which is composed of a hardware platform and its system software. The device typically provides wireless connectivity and may include software for functions like secure messaging, email, web, </span><:a href="https://www.niap-ccevs.org/MMO/PP/MDF%203.3%20PP/#abbr_VPN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">VPN</:a><span style="color: black;"> connection, and VoIP (Voice over </span><:a href="https://www.niap-ccevs.org/MMO/PP/MDF%203.3%20PP/#abbr_IP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">IP</:a><span style="color: black;">), for access to the protected enterprise network, enterprise data and applications, and for communicating to other Mobile Devices.</span></section>
    <sec:Use_Cases>
      <span style="color: black;">The Mobile Device may be operated in a number of use cases. </span><:a href="https://www.niap-ccevs.org/MMO/PP/MDF%203.3%20PP/#use-case-appendix" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">use-case-appendix</:a><span style="color: black;"> provides use case templates that list those selections, assignments, and objective requirements that best support the use cases identified by this Protection Profile. In addition to providing essential security services, the Mobile Device includes the necessary security functionality to support configurations for these various use cases. Each use case may require additional configuration and applications to achieve the desired security. A selection of these use cases is elaborated below.</span></:p><:p><span style="color: black;">Several of the use case templates include objective requirements that are strongly desired for the indicated use cases. Readers can expect those requirements to be made mandatory in a future revision of this protection profile, and industry should aim to include that security functionality in products in the near-term.</span></:p><:p><span style="color: black;">As of publication of this version of the Protection Profile, meeting the requirements in </span><:a href="https://www.niap-ccevs.org/MMO/PP/MDF%203.3%20PP/#Security_Requirements" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Section 5 Security Requirements</:a><span style="color: black;"> is necessary for all use cases.</span></:p><:p><span style="color: black;">An enterprise-owned device for general-purpose business use is commonly called </span><:i style="color: black;">Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE)<:i><span style="color: black;">. This use case entails a significant degree of enterprise control over configuration and, possibly, software inventory. The enterprise elects to provide users with Mobile Devices and additional applications (such as </span><:a href="https://www.niap-ccevs.org/MMO/PP/MDF%203.3%20PP/#abbr_VPN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">VPN</:a><span style="color: black;"> or email clients) in order to maintain control of their Enterprise data and security of their networks. Users may use Internet connectivity to browse the web or access corporate mail or run enterprise applications, but this connectivity may be under significant control of the enterprise.</span></:p><:p><span style="color: black;">For changes to included </span><:a href="https://www.niap-ccevs.org/MMO/PP/MDF%203.3%20PP/#abbr_SFR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">SFRs</:a><span style="color: black;">, selections, and assignments required for this use case, see </span><:a href="https://www.niap-ccevs.org/MMO/PP/MDF%203.3%20PP/#appendix-uc-enterprise" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">H.1 Enterprise-owned device for general-purpose enterprise use and limited personal use</:a><span style="color: black;">.</span>

                                    Regarding functions <xref to="mf-radios"/> and <xref to="mf-audioVisual"/>, 
                                    disablement of a particular 
                                      radio or audio/visual device must be effective as soon as the TOE has power. 
                                      Disablement must also apply when the TOE is booted into auxiliary boot modes, for 
                                      example, associated with updates or backup. If the TOE supports states in which 
                                      security management policy is inaccessible, for example, due to data-at-rest 
                                      protection, it is acceptable to meet this requirement by ensuring that these devices 
                                      are disabled by default while in these states. That these devices are disabled during 
                                      auxiliary boot modes does not imply that the device (particularly the cellular radio)

    <section title="Security Assurance Requirements">
      <:p>The Security Objectives for the TOE in were constructed to address threats identified in . The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) in are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs independent testing. This section lists the set of SARs from CC part 3 that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual Evaluation Activities (EAs) to be performed are specified both in as well as in this section. The general model for evaluation of TOEs against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows: After the ST has been approved for evaluation, the CCTL will obtain the TOE, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for the TOE. The CCTL is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The CCTL also performs the evaluation activities contained within , which are intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the TOE. The evaluation activities that are captured in also provide clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the TOE is compliant with the PP. The results of these activities will be documented and presented (along with the administrative guidance used) for validation.</:p>

      <section title="Class ADV: Development">
        The information about the TOE is contained in the guidance documentation available to the end user as well as the TSS portion of the ST. The TOE developer must concur with the description of the product that is contained in the TSS as it relates to the functional requirements. The evaluation activities contained in <xref to="SFRs"/> should provide the ST authors with sufficient information to determine the appropriate content for the TSS section.
        <a-component cc-id="adv_fsp.1" name="Basic Functional Specification">
          The functional specification describes the TSFIs. It is not necessary to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. Additionally, because TOEs conforming to this PP will necessarily have interfaces to the Operational Environment that are not directly invocable by TOE users,  there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this PP, the activities for this family should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in the TSS in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces presented in the AGD documentation. No additional “functional specification” documentation is necessary to satisfy the evaluation activities specified. The interfaces that need to be evaluated are characterized through the information needed to perform the assurance activities listed, rather than as an independent, abstract list.

            <note>As indicated in the introduction to this section, the functional specification is comprised of the information contained in the AGD_OPE and AGD_PRE documentation. The developer may reference a website accessible to application developers and the evaluator. The evaluation activities in the functional requirements point to evidence that should exist in the documentation and TSS section; since these are directly associated with the SFRs, the tracing in element ADV_FSP.1.2D is implicitly already done and no additional documentation is necessary.</note>
