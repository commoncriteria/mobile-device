    This assurance standard specifies information security requirements for Mobile Devices for use in an enterprise. A Mobile Device in the context of this assurance standard is a device, which is composed of a hardware platform and its system software. The device typically provides wireless connectivity and may include software for functions like secure messaging, email, web, VPN connection, and VoIP (Voice over IP), for access to the protected enterprise network, enterprise data and applications, and for communicating to other Mobile Devices.

    <htm:br/>
    Examples of a “Mobile Device” that should claim conformance to this Protection Profile include smartphones, tablet computers, and other Mobile Devices with similar capabilities. 
    <htm:br/><htm:br/>
    The Mobile Device provides essential services, such as cryptographic services, data-at-rest protection, and key storage services to support the secure operation of applications on the device. Additional security features such as security policy enforcement, application mandatory access control, anti-exploitation features, user authentication, and software integrity protection are implemented in order to address threats. 
    <htm:br/><htm:br/>
    This assurance standard describes these essential security services provided by the Mobile Device and serves as a foundation for a secure mobile architecture. The wireless connectivity shall be validated against the Extended Package for WLAN Client. As illustrated in <figref refid="TOE"/>, it is expected that a typical deployment would also include either third-party or bundled components. Whether these components are bundled as part of the Mobile Device by the manufacturer or developed by a third-party, they must be separately validated against the related assurance standards such as the Extended Package for Mobile Device Management Agents, Extended Package for IPsec VPN Client, and VoIP Application Extended Package. It is the responsibility of the architect of the overall secure mobile architecture to ensure validation of these components. Additional applications that may come pre-installed on the Mobile Device that are not validated are considered to be potentially flawed, but not malicious. Examples include email client and web browser.

  <section title="TOE Usage" id="toeus">
    The Mobile Device may be operated in a number of use cases. <appref linkend="use"/> provides use case templates that list those selections, assignments, and objective requirements that best support the use cases identified by this Protection Profile. In addition to providing essential security services, the Mobile Device includes the necessary security functionality to support configurations for these various use cases. Each use case may require additional configuration and applications to achieve the desired security. A selection of these use cases is elaborated below.
    <htm:br/><htm:br/>
    Several of the use case templates include objective requirements that are strongly desired for the indicated use cases. Readers can expect those requirements to be made mandatory in the next revision of this protection profile, and industry should aim to include that security functionality in products in the near-term. 
    <htm:br/><htm:br/>
    As of publication of this version of the Protection Profile, meeting the requirements in <secref linkend="sr"/> is necessary for all use cases.

    <htm:b>[<ctr pre="USE CASE " id="uc_entgenpurp"/>] Enterprise-owned device for general-purpose enterprise use and limited personal use</htm:b>
    <htm:br/><htm:br/>
    An enterprise-owned device for general-purpose business use is commonly called Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE). This use case entails a significant degree of enterprise control over configuration and, possibly, software inventory. The enterprise elects to provide users with Mobile Devices and additional applications (such as VPN or email clients) in order to maintain control of their Enterprise data and security of their networks. Users may use Internet connectivity to browse the web or access corporate mail or run enterprise applications, but this connectivity may be under significant control of the enterprise.

    <htm:b>[<ctr pre="USE CASE " id="uc_enthisec"/>] Enterprise-owned device for specialized, high-security use</htm:b>
    <htm:br/><htm:br/>
    An enterprise-owned device with intentionally limited network connectivity, tightly controlled configuration, and limited software inventory is appropriate for specialized, high-security use cases. For example, the device may not be permitted connectivity to any external peripherals. It may only be able to communicate via its Wi-Fi or cellular radios with the enterprise-run network, which may not even permit connectivity to the Internet. Use of the device may entail compliance with policies that are more restrictive than those in any general-purpose use case, yet may mitigate risks to highly sensitive information. As in the previous case, the enterprise will look for additional applications providing enterprise connectivity and services to have a similar level of assurance as the platform.

    <htm:b>[<ctr pre="USE CASE " id="uc_pergenpurp"/>] Personally-owned device for personal and enterprise use</htm:b>
    <htm:br/><htm:br/>
    A personally-owned device, which is used, for both personal activities and enterprise data is commonly called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). The device may be provisioned for access to enterprise resources after significant personal usage has occurred. Unlike in the enterprise-owned cases, the enterprise is limited in what security policies it can enforce because the user purchased the device primarily for personal use and is unlikely to accept policies that limit the functionality of the device. However, because the enterprise allows the user full (or nearly full) access to the enterprise network, the enterprise will require their own security controls to ensure that enterprise resources are protected from potential threats posed by the personal activities on the device. These controls could potentially be enforced by a separation mechanism built-in to the device itself to distinguish between enterprise and personal activities, or by a third-party application that provides access to enterprise resources and leverages security capabilities provided by the mobile device. Based upon the operational environment and the acceptable risk level of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in <secref linkend="sr"/> of this <abbr linkend="PP"/> along with the selections in the Use Case 3 template defined in <appref linkend="use"/> are sufficient for the secure implementation of this BYOD use case.

    A personally-owned device, which is used, for both personal activities and enterprise data is commonly called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). This device may be provisioned for limited access to enterprise resources such as enterprise email. Because the user does not have full access to the enterprise or enterprise data, the enterprise may not need to enforce any security policies on the device. However, the enterprise may want secure email and web browsing with assurance that the services being provided to those clients by the Mobile Device are not compromised. Based upon the operational environment and the acceptable risk level of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in <secref linkend="sr"/> of this <abbr linkend="PP"/> are sufficient for the secure implementation of this BYOD use case.

They may also conduct attacks against the platform’s system software, which will provide them with additional privileges and the ability to conduct further malicious activities. Malicious applications may be able to control the device's sensors (GPS, camera, microphone) to gather intelligence about the user's surroundings even when those activities do not involve data resident or transmitted from the device.

The user shall be notified of any failure of these self-tests. This will protect against the threat T.PERSISTENT.
            <htm:br/><htm:br/>
            To address the issue of an application containing malicious or flawed code (T.FLAWAPP), the integrity of downloaded updates to software/firmware will be verified prior to installation/execution of the object on the Mobile Device. In addition, the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> will restrict applications to only have access to the system services and data they are permitted to interact with. The <abbr linkend="TOE"/> will further protect against malicious applications from gaining access to data they are not authorized to access by randomizing the memory layout.

            In a BYOD environment (use cases 3 and 4), a personally-owned mobile device is used for both personal activities and enterprise data. Enterprise management solutions may have the technical capability to monitor and enforce security policies on the device. However, the privacy of the personal activities and data must be ensured. In addition, since there are limited controls that the enterprise can enforce on the personal side, separation of personal and enterprise data is needed. This will protect against the T.FLAWAPP and T.PERSISTENT threats.

              The evaluator shall check the administrative guide and ensure that it lists all of the auditable events and provides a format for audit records. Each audit record format type must be covered, along with a brief description of each field. The evaluator shall check to make sure that every audit event type mandated by the <abbr linkend="PP"/> is described and that the description of the fields contains the information required in <linkref linkend="FAU_GEN.1.2"/>. 
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              The evaluator shall also make a determination of the administrative actions that are relevant in the context of this <abbr linkend="PP"/> including those listed in the Management section. The evaluator shall examine the administrative guide and make a determination of which administrative commands are related to the configuration (including enabling or disabling) of the mechanisms implemented in the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> that are necessary to enforce the requirements specified in the <abbr linkend="PP"/>. The evaluator shall document the methodology or approach taken while determining which actions in the administrative guide are security relevant with respect to this <abbr linkend="PP"/>. The evaluator may perform this activity as part of the activities associated with ensuring the AGD_OPE guidance satisfies the requirements.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              The evaluator shall test the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>’s ability to correctly generate audit records by having the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> generate audit records for the events listed in the provided table and administrative actions. This should include all instances of an event. The evaluator shall test that audit records are generated for the establishment and termination of a channel for each of the cryptographic protocols contained in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>. For administrative actions, the evaluator shall test that each action determined by the evaluator above to be security relevant in the context of this <abbr linkend="PP"/> is auditable. When verifying the test results, the evaluator shall ensure the audit records generated during testing match the format specified in the administrative guide, and that the fields specified in <linkref linkend="FAU_GEN.1.2"/> are contained in each audit record.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              Note that the testing here can be accomplished in conjunction with the testing of the security mechanisms directly. For example, testing performed to ensure that the administrative guidance provided is correct verifies that AGD_OPE.1 is satisfied and should address the invocation of the administrative actions that are needed to verify the audit records are generated as expected.

        This section describes how keys are generated, derived, combined, released and destroyed. There are two major types of keys: <abbr linkend="DEK"/>s and <abbr linkend="KEK"/>s. (A <abbr linkend="REK"/> is considered a <abbr linkend="KEK"/>.) <abbr linkend="DEK"/>s are used to protect data (as in the DAR protection described in <linkref linkend="FDP_DAR_EXT.1"/> and <linkref linkend="FDP_DAR_EXT.2"/>). <abbr linkend="KEK"/>s are used to protect other keys – <abbr linkend="DEK"/>s, other <abbr linkend="KEK"/>s, and other types of keys stored by the user or applications. The following diagram shows an example key hierarchy to illustrate the concepts of this profile. This example is not meant as an approved design, but <abbr linkend="ST"/> authors will be expected to provide a diagram illustrating their key hierarchy in order to demonstrate that they meet the requirements of this profile. Please note if a <abbr linkend="BAF"/> is selected in <linkref linkend="FIA_UAU.5.1"/>, the <abbr linkend="BAF"/> shall be illustrated in the key hierarchy diagram, to include a description of when and how the <abbr linkend="BAF"/> is used to release keys. If “hybrid” is selected in <linkref linkend="FIA_UAU.5.1"/>, meaning that a PIN or password must be used in conjunction with the <abbr linkend="BAF"/> this interaction shall be included.<htm:br/>

These validation tests for each key agreement scheme verify that a <abbr linkend="TOE"/> has implemented the components of the key agreement scheme according to the specifications in the Recommendation. These components include the calculation of the DLC primitives (the shared secret value Z) and the calculation of the derived keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function (KDF).

              The Function test verifies the ability of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> to implement the key agreement schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known good implementation of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> supported schemes. For each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type, and, if supported, key confirmation role- key confirmation type combination, the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. The data set consists of one set of domain parameter values (FFC) or the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being tested.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              The evaluator shall obtain the DKM, the corresponding <abbr linkend="TOE"/>’s public keys (static and/or ephemeral), the MAC tag(s), and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other Information field OI and <abbr linkend="TOE"/> id fields.

              The Validity test verifies the ability of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> to recognize another party’s valid and invalid key agreement results with or without key confirmation. To conduct this test, the evaluator shall obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A key agreement implementation to determine which errors the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> should be able to recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24 (FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors consisting of data sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves, the evaluator’s public keys, the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>’s public/private key pairs, MACTag, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the other info and <abbr linkend="TOE"/> id fields.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being incorrect: the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the data to be MACed, or the generated MACTag. If the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> contains the full or partial (only ECC) public key validation, the evaluator will also individually inject errors in both parties’ static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>’s static private key to assure the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> detects errors in the public key validation function and/or the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test vectors shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results (they should pass).
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              The <abbr linkend="TOE"/> shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>’s results with the results using a known good implementation verifying that the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> detects these errors.

For each combination of supported key establishment scheme and its options (with or without key confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test vector shall include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any additional input parameters if applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext.

              There are multiple situations in which plaintext keying material is no longer necessary, including when the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> is powered off, when the wipe function is performed, when trusted channels are disconnected, when keying material is no longer needed by the trusted channel per the protocol, and when transitioning to the locked state (for those values derived from the Password Authentication Factor or that key material which is protected by the password-derived or biometric-unlocked <abbr linkend="KEK"/> according to <linkref linkend="FCS_STG_EXT.2"/> – see <figref refid="Keys"/>). For keys (or key material used to derive those keys) protecting sensitive data received in the locked state, “no longer needed” includes “while in the locked state.”

                  Step 7 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in memory. If a fragment is found, there is a minuscule chance that it is not within the context of a key (e.g., some random bits that happen to match). If this is the case the test should be repeated with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is found the test fails.

It is expected that vendors will implement SHA-2 algorithms in accordance with SP 800-131A.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              SHA-1 is currently required in order to comply with the WLAN Client Extended Package. Vendors are strongly encouraged to implement updated protocols that support the SHA-2 family; until updated protocols are supported, this <abbr linkend="PP"/> allows support for SHA-1 implementations in compliance with SP 800-131A.

              The intent of this requirement is to specify the hashing function. The hash selection must support the message digest size selection. The hash selection should be consistent with the overall strength of the algorithm used (for example, SHA 256 for 128-bit keys).

              The evaluator checks the AGD documents to determine that any configuration that is required to be done to configure the functionality for the required hash sizes is present. The evaluator shall check that the association of the hash function with other <abbr linkend="TSF"/> cryptographic functions (for example, the digital signature verification function) is documented in the  <abbr linkend="TSS"/>.

              The <abbr linkend="TSF"/> hashing functions can be implemented in one of two modes. The first mode is the byte­oriented mode. In this mode the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> only hashes messages that are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e. the length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is the bit­oriented mode. In this mode the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> hashes messages of arbitrary length. As there are different tests for each mode, an indication is given in the following sections for the bit­oriented vs. the byte­oriented testmacs.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              The <abbr linkend="TSF"/> may implement either bit-oriented or byte-oriented; both implementations are not required. The evaluator shall perform all of the following tests for each hash algorithm implemented by the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> and used to satisfy the requirements of this <abbr linkend="PP"/>.

              For the selection in <linkref linkend="FCS_RBG_EXT.1.2"/>, the <abbr linkend="ST"/> author selects the appropriate number of bits of entropy that corresponds to the greatest security strength of the algorithms included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>. Security strength is defined in Tables 2 and 3 of NIST SP 800-57A. For example, if the implementation includes 2048-bit RSA (security strength of 112 bits), AES 128 (security strength 128 bits), and HMAC-SHA-256 (security strength 256 bits), then the <abbr linkend="ST"/> author would select 256 bits.

              The <abbr linkend="ST"/> author may select either software or hardware noise sources. A hardware noise source is a component that produces data that cannot be explained by a deterministic rule, due to its physical nature. In other words, a hardware based noise source generates sequences of random numbers from a physical process that cannot be predicted. For example, a sampled ring oscillator consists of an odd number of inverter gates chained into a loop, with an electrical pulse traveling from inverter to inverter around the loop. The inverters are not clocked, so the precise time required for a complete circuit around the loop varies slightly as various physical effects modify the small delay time at each inverter on the line to the next inverter. This variance results in an approximate natural frequency that contains drift and jitter over time. The output of the ring oscillator consists of the oscillating binary value sampled at a constant rate from one of the inverters – a rate that is significantly slower than the oscillator’s natural frequency.

Since there is no guarantee of the protections provided when the state is stored (or a requirement for any such protection), it is assumed that the state is 'known', and therefore cannot contribute entropy to the RBG, but can introduce enough variation that the initial RBG values are not predictable and exploitable.</note>

The evaluator shall verify that the documentation describes how the state is generated so as to be available for the next startup, how the state is used as input to the DRBG, and any protection measures used for the state while the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> is powered off.

Put simply, the TOE may propose any ciphersuite; however, the evaluation will only test the ciphersuites in the above list. The ST author should select the optional ciphersuites that are supported; if there are no ciphersuites supported other than the mandatory suites, then “None” should be selected. It is necessary to limit the ciphersuites that can be used in an evaluated configuration administratively on the server in the test environment. The Suite B algorithms listed above (RFC 6460) are the preferred algorithms for implementation. It is recognized that RFC 5246 mandates the ciphersuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, but this ciphersuite is not tested with this requirement.<htm:br></htm:br><htm:br></htm:br>

The evaluator shall also check the operational guidance to ensure that it contains instructions on configuring the TOE so that TLS conforms to the description in the TSS.<htm:br></htm:br><htm:br></htm:br>
            The evaluator shall write, or the ST author shall provide, an application for the purposes of testing TLS. The evaluator shall also perform the following tests:
            <testlist>
              <test>The evaluator shall establish a TLS connection using each of the ciphersuites specified by the requirement. This connection may be established as part of the establishment of a higher-level protocol, e.g., as part of an EAP session. It is sufficient to observe the successful negotiation of a ciphersuite to satisfy the intent of the test; it is not necessary to examine the characteristics of the encrypted traffic in an attempt to discern the ciphersuite being used (for example, that the cryptographic algorithm is 128-bit AES and not 256-bit AES).</test>
              <test>The evaluator shall attempt to establish the connection using a server with a server certificate that contains the Server Authentication purpose in the extendedKeyUsage field and verify that a connection is established. The evaluator will then verify that the client rejects an otherwise valid server certificate that lacks the Server Authentication purpose in the extendedKeyUsage field and a connection is not established. Ideally, the two certificates should be identical except for the extendedKeyUsage field.</test>
              <test>The evaluator shall send a server certificate in the TLS connection that the does not match the server-selected ciphersuite (for example, send a ECDSA certificate while using the TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA ciphersuite or send a RSA certificate while using one of the ECDSA ciphersuites.) The evaluator shall verify that the TOE disconnects after receiving the server’s Certificate handshake message.</test>
              <test>The evaluator shall configure the server to select the TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL ciphersuite and verify that the client denies the connection.</test>
              <test>The evaluator shall perform the following modifications to the traffic:<htm:br></htm:br>
                <htm:ul>
                  <htm:li>Change the TLS version selected by the server in the Server Hello to a non-supported TLS version (for example, 1.3 represented by the two bytes 03 04) and verify that the client rejects the connection.</htm:li>

          <title>The TSF shall verify that the presented identifier matches the reference identifier according to RFC 6125.
          </title>
          <note role="application">The rules for verification of identify are described in Section 6 of RFC 6125. The reference identifier is established by the user (e.g. entering a URL into a web browser or clicking a link), by configuration (e.g. configuring the name of a mail server or authentication server), or by an application (e.g. a parameter of an API) depending on the application service. Based on a singular reference identifier’s source domain and application service type (e.g. HTTP, SIP, LDAP), the client establishes all reference identifiers which are acceptable, such as a Common Name for the Subject Name field of the certificate and a (case-insensitive) DNS name, URI name, and Service Name for the Subject Alternative Name field. The client then compares this list of all acceptable reference identifiers to the presented identifiers in the TLS server’s certificate.<htm:br></htm:br><htm:br></htm:br>
            The preferred method for verification is the Subject Alternative Name using DNS names, URI names, or Service Names. Verification using the Common Name is required for the purposes of backwards compatibility. Additionally, support for use of IP addresses in the Subject Name or Subject Alternative name is discouraged as against best practices but may be implemented. Finally, the client should avoid constructing reference identifiers using wildcards. However, if the presented identifiers include wildcards, the client must follow the best practices regarding matching; these best practices are captured in the assurance activity.
          </note>
          <aactivity>The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes the client’s method of establishing all reference identifiers from the application-configured reference identifier, including which types of reference identifiers are supported (e.g. Common Name, DNS Name, URI Name, Service Name, or other application-specific Subject Alternative Names) and whether IP addresses and wildcards are supported. The evaluator shall ensure that this description identifies whether and the manner in which certificate pinning is supported or used by the TOE.<htm:br></htm:br><htm:br></htm:br>

        All keys, protected data, and sensitive data must ultimately be protected by the <abbr linkend="REK"/>. Sensitive data must be protected by the password in addition to the <abbr linkend="REK"/>. In particular, <figref refid="Keys"/> has <abbr linkend="KEK"/>s protected according to these requirements: DEK_1 would be appropriate for sensitive data, DEK_2 would not be appropriate for sensitive data, K_1 is not considered a sensitive key, and K_2 is considered a sensitive key.
        <htm:br></htm:br><htm:br></htm:br>
        These requirements include a capability for encrypting sensitive data received while in the locked state, which may be considered a separate sub-category of sensitive data. This capability may be met by a key transport scheme (RSA) by using a public key to encrypt the <abbr linkend="DEK"/> while protecting the corresponding private key with a password-derived or biometric-unlocked <abbr linkend="KEK"/>. 
        <htm:br></htm:br><htm:br></htm:br>
        This capability may also be met by a key agreement scheme. To do so, the device generates a device-wide sensitive data asymmetric pair (the private key of which is protected by a password-derived or biometric-unlocked <abbr linkend="KEK"/>) and an asymmetric pair for the received sensitive data to be stored. In order to store the sensitive data, the device-wide public key and data private key are used to generate a shared secret, which can be used as a <abbr linkend="KEK"/> or a <abbr linkend="DEK"/>. The data private key and shared secret are cleared after the data is encrypted and the data public key stored. Thus, no key material is available in the locked state to decrypt the newly stored data. Upon unlock, the device-wide private key is decrypted and is used with each data public key to regenerate the shared secret and decrypt the stored data. <figref refid="KeysLocked"/>, below, illustrates this scheme.

              An unique authentication attempt is defined as any attempt to verify a password or biometric sample, in which the input is different from a previous attempt. ‘Unique’ shall be selected if the authentication system increments the counter only for unique unsuccessful authentication attempts. For example, if the same incorrect password is attempted twice the authentication system increments the counter once. ‘Non-unique’ shall be selected if the authentication system increments the counter for each unsuccessful authentication attempt, regardless of if the input is unique. For example, if the same incorrect password is attempted twice the authentication system increments the counter twice.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              If hybrid authentication (i.e. a combination of biometric and pin/password) is supported, a failed authentication attempt can be counted as a single attempt, even if both the biometric and pin/password were incorrect.

              Generally testing environments for a biometric system in a mobile device are based on a single legitimate user enrolling and test subjects attempt to authenticate. Since a thorough evaluation for <abbr linkend="FAR"/> and <abbr linkend="FRR"/> meeting all the conditions of statistical independence is not feasible in the timeframe of <abbr linkend="CC"/> evaluations and in agreement with ISO/IEC 19795, the use of offline testing is acceptable even if this causes the biometric system to deviate slightly from the evaluated configuration.

                <htm:br/><htm:br/>
                System Authentication False Accept Rate (SAFAR) is defined by the combination of individual error rates for each authentication factor and attempts used for access to a single session on the device. 
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
                Accessing a single session may involve a single authentication factor, in which case the SAFAR for a single attempt will be equal to the false accept rate (<abbr linkend="FAR"/>) of that authentication factor and the SAFAR for n attempts will be <htm:img src="images/SAFAR_basic.jpg"/>, assuming independence. 
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>             
              Accessing a single session on the device may involve the ability to use multiple authentication factors. It may be the case that only one authentication factor is needed to access a single session on the device (i.e. both a password and a <abbr linkend="BAF"/> can be used, but only one is needed) or that both authentication factors are needed to access a single session on the device (i.e. both the <abbr linkend="BAF"/> and a PIN must be entered). The full equations for calculating the SAFAR can be found in <appref linkend="biometric3"/>. A fully worked-out example that applies the equations in <appref linkend="biometric3"/> for calculating the SAFAR can be found in <appref linkend="biometric4"/>.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              The worst-case scenario shall be used to calculate the SAFAR. Thus the authentication factor with the highest FAR shall be used for the maximum number of authentication attempts allowed for that factor. If any authentication attempts remain, then the authentication factor with the second highest <abbr linkend="FAR"/> is used for the maximum number of authentication attempts allowed for that factor and so on. For example, the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> supports a password and a <abbr linkend="BAF"/>, the <abbr linkend="FAR"/> for the <abbr linkend="BAF"/> is higher than the <abbr linkend="FAR"/> for the password and each authentication factor utilizes a shared counter per <linkref linkend="FIA_AFL_EXT.1"/>. Then the worst-case scenario is the <abbr linkend="BAF"/> is utilized for the maximum number of authentication attempts allowed for the <abbr linkend="BAF"/>. For any remaining authentication attempts allowed the password is utilized.          
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              Another example is the TOE supports a password and two <abbr linkend="BAF"/>s, where the <abbr linkend="BAF"/>s have different <abbr linkend="FAR"/>s, with both <abbr linkend="FAR"/>s being higher than the password <abbr linkend="FAR"/>. Then the worst-case scenario is that the <abbr linkend="BAF"/> with the highest <abbr linkend="FAR"/> is used for the maximum number of authentication attempts allowed for that <abbr linkend="BAF"/>, followed by the second <abbr linkend="BAF"/> if any authentication attempts are allowed for that <abbr linkend="BAF"/>. If any authentication attempts remain, then the password is utilized for those attempts.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              The 1% margin is included for cases where a <abbr linkend="BAF"/> is not a critical authentication factor and thus both <abbr linkend="BAF"/> and password can be used in a session without exceeding the declared SAFAR.

The <abbr linkend="ST"/> author shall select whether revocation status is verified using OCSP or CRLs. The WLAN Client EP to which a MDF <abbr linkend="TOE"/> must also conform requires that certificates are used for EAP-TLS; this use requires that the extendedKeyUsage rules are verified. Certificates may optionally be used for trusted updates of system software and applications (<linkref linkend="FPT_TUD_EXT.2"/>) and for integrity verification (<linkref linkend="FPT_TST_EXT.2(1)"/>) and, if implemented, must be validated to contain the Code Signing purpose extendedKeyUsage.

              While <linkref linkend="FIA_X509_EXT.1.1"/> requires that the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> perform certain checks on the certificate presented by a TLS server, there are corresponding checks that the authentication server will have to perform on the certificate presented by the client; namely that the extendedKeyUsage field of the client certificate includes "Client Authentication" and that the key agreement bit (for the Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites) or the key encipherment bit (for RSA ciphersuites) be set. Certificates obtained for use by the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> will have to conform to these requirements in order to be used in the enterprise. This check is required to support EAP-TLS for the WLAN Client EP.

              The second column (<linkref linkend="FMT_SMF_EXT.1"/>) indicates whether the function is to be implemented. The <abbr linkend="ST"/> author should select which Optional functions are implemented.

              The third column (<linkref linkend="FMT_MOF_EXT.1.1"/>) indicates functions that are to be restricted to the user (i.e. not available to the administrator).
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              The fourth column (Administrator) indicates functions that are available to the administrator. The functions restricted to the user (column 3) cannot also be available to the administrator. Functions available to the administrator can still be available to the user, as long as the function is not restricted to the administrator (column 5). Thus, if the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> must offer these functions to the administrator to perform the fourth column shall be selected.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              The fifth column (<linkref linkend="FMT_MOF_EXT.1.2"/>) indicates whether the function is to be restricted to the administrator when the device is enrolled and the administrator applies the indicated policy. If the function is restricted to the administrator the function is not available to the user. This does not prevent the user from modifying a setting to make the function stricter, but the user cannot undo the configuration enforced by the administrator.

              The <abbr linkend="ST"/> author may use a table in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>, listing only those functions that are implemented. For functions that are mandatory, any sub-functions not in a selection are also mandatory and any assignments must contain at least one assigned value. For functions that are optional and contain an assignment or selection, at least one value must be assigned/selected to be included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>. For non-selectable sub-functions in an optional function, all sub-functions must be implemented in order for the function to be included. For functions with a “per-app basis” sub function and an assignment, the <abbr linkend="ST"/> author must indicate which assigned features are manageable on a per-app basis and which are not by iterating the row.

              Function 3 addresses enabling and disabling the IPsec VPN only. The configuration of the VPN Client itself (with information such as VPN Gateway, certificates, and algorithms) is addressed by the IPsec VPN Client Extended Package. The administrator options should only be listed if the administrator can remotely enable/disable the VPN connection.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              Function 3 optionally allows the VPN to be configured per-app or per-groups of apps. If this configuration is selected, it does not void <linkref linkend="FDP_IFC_EXT.1"/>. Instead <linkref linkend="FDP_IFC_EXT.1"/> is applied to the application or group of applications the VPN is applied to. In other words, all traffic destined for the VPN-enabled application or group of applications, must travel through the VPN, but traffic not destined for that application or group of applications can travel outside the VPN. When the VPN is configured across the device <linkref linkend="FDP_IFC_EXT.1"/> applies to all traffic and the VPN must not split tunnel.

              The assignment in function 4 consists of all radios present on the <abbr linkend="TSF"/>, such as Wi-Fi, GPS, cellular, NFC, Bluetooth BR/EDR, and Bluetooth LE, which can be enabled and disabled. In the future, if both Bluetooth BR/EDR and Bluetooth LE are supported, they will be required to be enabled and disabled separately. Disablement of the cellular radio does not imply that the radio may not be enabled in order to place emergency phone calls; however, it is not expected that a device in “airplane mode”, where all radios are disabled, will automatically (without authorization) turn on the cellular radio to place emergency calls. 
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              The assignment in function 5 consists of at least one audio and/or visual device, such as camera and microphone, which can be enabled and disabled by either the user or administrator. Disablement of the microphone does not imply that the microphone may not be enabled in order to place emergency phone calls. If certain devices are able to be restricted to the enterprise (either device-wide, per-app or per-group of applications) and others are able to be restricted to users, then this function should be iterated in the table with the appropriate table entries.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              Regarding functions 4 and 5, disablement of a particular radio or audio/visual device must be effective as soon as the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> has power. Disablement must also apply when the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> is booted into auxiliary boot modes, for example, associated with updates or backup. If the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> supports states in which security management policy is inaccessible, for example, due to data-at-rest protection, it is acceptable to meet this requirement by ensuring that these devices are disabled by default while in these states. That these devices are disabled during auxiliary boot modes does not imply that the device (particularly the cellular radio) may not be enabled in order to perform emergency phone calls.

              In the future, function 12 may require destruction or disabling of any default trusted CA certificates, excepting those CA certificates necessary for continued operation of the <abbr linkend="TSF"/>, such as the developer’s certificate. At this time, the <abbr linkend="ST"/> author shall indicate in the assignment whether pre-installed or any other category of X.509v3 certificates may be removed from the Trust Anchor Database.

              For function 13, the enrollment function may be installing an <abbr linkend="MDM"/> agent and includes the policies to be applied to the device. It is acceptable for the user approval notice to require the user to intentionally opt to view the policies (for example, by “tapping” on a “View” icon) rather than listing the policies in full in the notice.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              For function 15, the administrator capability to update the system software may be limited to causing a prompt to the user to update rather than the ability to initiate the update itself. As the administrator is likely to be acting remotely, he/she would be unaware of inopportune situations, such as low power, which may cause the update to fail and the device to become inoperable. The user can refuse to accept the update in such situations. It is expected that system architects will be cognizant of this limitation and will enforce network access controls in order to enforce enterprise-critical updates.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              Function 16 addresses both installation and update. This protection profile does not distinguish between installation and update of applications because mobile devices typically completely overwrite the previous installation with a new installation during an application update.

              For function 17, “Enterprise applications” are those applications that belong to the Enterprise application group.

Disablement of data transfer over an external port must be effective during and after boot into the normal operative mode of the device. If the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> supports states in which configured security management policy is inaccessible, for example, due to data-at-rest protection, it is acceptable to meet this requirement by ensuring that data transfer is disabled by default while in these states. Each of the ports may be enabled or disabled separately. The configuration policy need not disable all ports together. In the case of USB, chagrining is still allowed if data transfer capabilities have been disabled.

The evaluator shall wait 2 minutes at each Authentication Factor interface prior to entering the necessary password to complete the boot process, waiting 5 minutes after the device is fully booted. The evaluator shall observe that RF spikes are present at the expected uplink channel frequency. The evaluator shall clear the “Max Hold” on the spectrum analyzer. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
                
                Step 3: The evaluator shall verify the absence of RF activity for the uplink channel when the radio in question is disabled. The evaluator shall complete the following test five times. The evaluator shall power on the device, ensure the radio in question is disabled, power off the device, enable “Max Hold” on the spectrum analyzer and power on the device. The evaluator shall wait 2 minutes at each Authentication Factor interface prior to entering the necessary password to complete the boot process, waiting 5 minutes after the device is fully booted. The evaluator shall clear the “Max Hold” on the spectrum analyzer. If a spike of RF activity for the uplink channel of the specific radio frequency band is observed at any time (either at an Authentication Factor interface or when the device is fully booted) it is deemed that the radio is enabled.

      The Security Objectives in <secref linkend="sobj"/> were constructed to address threats identified in <secref linkend="spd"/>. The Security Functional Requirements (<abbr linkend="SFR"/>s) in <secref linkend="sfr"/> are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (<abbr linkend="SAR"/>s) to frame the extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs independent testing.<htm:br/><htm:br/> 
      
      This section lists the set of <abbr linkend="SAR"/>s from CC part 3 that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual Assurance Activities
      to be performed are specified both in <secref linkend="sfr"/> as well as in this section. <htm:br/><htm:br/>  
      
      The general model for evaluation of <abbr linkend="TOE"/>s against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows: <htm:br/> <htm:br/> 
      
      After the <abbr linkend="ST"/> has been approved for evaluation, the <abbr class="expanded" title="Information Technology Security Evaluation Facility">ITSEF</abbr> will obtain the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Assurance Activities contained within <secref linkend="sfr"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>. The Assurance Activities that are captured in <secref linkend="sfr"/> also provide clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> is compliant with the PP. <htm:br/> <htm:br/>

        Testing is specified for functional aspects of the system as well as aspects that take advantage of design or implementation weaknesses. The former is done through the ATE_IND family, while the latter is through the AVA_VAN family.

One of the primary outputs of the evaluation process is the test report as specified in the following requirements. <htm:br></htm:br><htm:br></htm:br>
        Since many of the APIs are not exposed at the user interface (e.g., touch screen), the ability to stimulate the necessary interfaces requires a developer’s test environment.

The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in the <cite linkend="CEM"/> and the body of this PP’s Assurance Activities. While it is not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in the <abbr linkend="ST"/> is covered. <htm:br></htm:br><htm:br></htm:br>
                The test plan identifies the platforms to be tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in the <abbr linkend="ST"/> are tested, then no rationale is necessary. <htm:br></htm:br><htm:br></htm:br>
                The test plan describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely affect the performance of the functionality by the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> and its platform. This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS/HTTPS, SSH). <htm:br></htm:br><htm:br></htm:br>
                The test plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting details), and not just the “pass” result.</aactivity>

  <appendix id="optional" title="Optional Requirements">
    The baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> or its underlying platform) are contained in the body of this <abbr linkend="PP"/>. Additionally, there are three other types of requirements specified in <appref linkend="optional"/>, <appref linkend="sel-based"/>, and <appref linkend="objective"/>.
    <htm:br/><htm:br/>
    The first type (in this Appendix) are requirements that can be included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>, but are not required in order for a <abbr linkend="TOE"/> to claim conformance to this <abbr linkend="PP"/>. The second type (in <appref linkend="sel-based"/>) are requirements based on selections in the body of the <abbr linkend="PP"/>: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements in that appendix must be included. The third type (in <appref linkend="objective"/>) are components that are not required in order to conform to this <abbr linkend="PP"/>, but will be included in the baseline requirements in future versions of this <abbr linkend="PP"/>, so adoption by Mobile Device vendors is encouraged. Note that the <abbr linkend="ST"/> author is responsible for ensuring that requirements that may be associated with those in <appref linkend="optional"/>, <appref linkend="sel-based"/>, and <appref linkend="objective"/> but are not listed (e.g., FMT-type requirements) are also included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>. 
    <htm:br/><htm:br/>
    At this time there are no requirements that are strictly optional based on the discretion of the <abbr linkend="ST"/> author. All requirements indicated in these appendices are conditionally optional, either because they are included in the event that a certain selection is made in a mandatory <abbr linkend="SFR"/> or because claiming that the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> supports a particular use case mandates the inclusion of one or more of them.
  </appendix>
  <appendix id="sel-based" title="Selection-Based Requirements">
    As indicated in the introduction to this <abbr linkend="PP"/>, the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> or its underlying platform) are contained in the body of this <abbr linkend="PP"/>. There are additional requirements based on selections in the body of the <abbr linkend="PP"/>: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements below will need to be included.
  </appendix>
  <appendix id="objective" title="Objective Requirements">
    This Appendix includes requirements that specify security functionality, which also addresses threats. The requirements are not currently mandated in the body of this <abbr linkend="PP"/> as they describe security functionality not yet widely-available in commercial technology. However, these requirements may be included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/> such that the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> is still conformant to this <abbr linkend="PP"/>, and it is expected that they be included as soon as possible.
  </appendix>
  <appendix id="entropy" title="Entropy Documentation And Assessment">
    The documentation of the entropy source should be detailed enough that, after reading, the evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide entropy. This documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation is not required to be part of the  <abbr linkend="TSS"/>. 
    <section id="description" title="Design Description">Documentation shall include the design of the entropy source as a whole, including the interaction of all entropy source components. It will describe the operation of the entropy source to include how it works, how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source design indicating where the random comes from, where it is passed next, any post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking) should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged. 
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate. 
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      If implemented, the design description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included.
    </section>
    <section id="justification" title="Entropy Justification">There should be a technical argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence in the entropy source exhibiting probabilistic behavior (an explanation of the probability distribution and justification for that distribution given the particular source is one way to describe this). This argument will include a description of the expected entropy rate and explain how you ensure that sufficient entropy is going into the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with entropy.
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      The entropy justification shall not include any data added from any third-party application or from any state saving between restarts.
    </section>
    <section id="conditions" title="Operating Conditions">Documentation will also include the range of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. It will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the entropy source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall describe the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction or become inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included. </section>
    <section id="testing" title="Health Testing">More specifically, all entropy source health tests and their rationale will be documented. This will include a description of the health tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at startup, continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, and rationale indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in the entropy source.</section>

  <appendix id="use" title="Use Case Templates">
    The following use case templates list those selections, assignments, and objective requirements that best support the use cases identified by this Protection Profile. Note that the templates assume that all <abbr linkend="SFR"/>s listed in <secref linkend="sfr"/> are included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>, not just those listed in the templates. These templates and deviations from the template should be identified in the Security Target to assist customers with making risk-based purchasing decisions. Products that do not meet these templates are not precluded from use in the scenarios identified by this Protection Profile. 
    <htm:br/><htm:br/>
    Several of the use cases templates include objective requirements that are strongly desired for the indicated use cases. Readers can expect those requirements to be made mandatory in the next revision of this protection profile, and industry should aim to include that security functionality in products in the near-term. 
    <htm:br/><htm:br/>
    Where selections for a particular requirement are not identified in a use case template, all available selections are equally applicable to the use case.

  <appendix id="biometric" title="Biometric Derivation and Examples">
    <section id="biometric1" title="Experimental Setups And Error Bars In Testing FAR And FRR">
      <subsection id="sub1" title="Introduction">
        For the purposes of this <abbr linkend="PP"/>, <linkref linkend="FIA_BMG_EXT.1"/> requires testing for <abbr linkend="FAR"/>, <abbr linkend="FRR"/> and SAFAR if a <abbr linkend="BAF"/> is included in the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>. In this version of the <abbr linkend="PP"/> it is expected that the vendor will provide evidence to the evaluator of the testing completed to support the claimed <abbr linkend="FAR"/> and <abbr linkend="FRR"/>. This Appendix provides a guide to how this testing could be done and to what error bars are expected when the Rule of 3 is applied. This guide should be treated as a reference and not as a NIAP mandate, requirement, or set of mandates or requirements. 
        <htm:br/><htm:br/>
        </subsection>
        
        <subsection id="sub2" title="Testing environment that could meet FIA_BMG_EXT.1.1">
        In performing tests for <abbr linkend="FAR"/> and <abbr linkend="FRR"/>, ISO/IEC 19795-1 recommends that vendors or testing labs use the largest test population that can be reasonably managed. Generally, testing environments for mobile devices are based upon individual devices with their own local authentication templates/profiles where the submitted biometric samples are destroyed after submission. It is infeasible to meet the given timeframe for CC evaluations of mobile devices if offline testing is not supported. Either online or offline testing is acceptable. The number of test subjects needed to support a claimed <abbr linkend="FAR"/> and <abbr linkend="FRR"/>, will depend on if online or offline testing is used due to how the subjects are compared. 
        <htm:br/><htm:br/>
        If online testing is utilized, it is expected that the testing is conducted directly on the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>. The legitimate user will enroll on the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> and all test subjects will be compared to only the legitimate user. Thus if the target <abbr linkend="FAR"/> is 1:100, at least 300 independent samples shall be used corresponding to 300 users and at least 300 independent trials are required in testing this <abbr linkend="FAR"/>. It is acceptable that multiple <abbr linkend="TOE"/>s, each with a different legitimate user, could be used to reduce the number of test subjects needed for online testing. With the assumption that the test subjects are compared against all legitimate users and no legitimate users are counted as test subjects, if <htm:i>N<htm:sub>D</htm:sub></htm:i> devices are used, the number of test subjects needed can be divided by <htm:i>N<htm:sub>D</htm:sub></htm:i>. 
        <htm:br/><htm:br/>
        If offline testing is used, it is expected that the biometric system used for testing will not be in the evaluated configuration of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> to allow for a full cross-comparison, in which the biometric sample from the test subjects is compared with every non-self template. It is expected, that the biometric system used for testing will collect samples and generate templates exactly the same as the biometric system in the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>. However, even though the comparison to determine if a valid sample is provided (i.e. matching algorithm) should remain the same, it is acceptable if the biometric system is modified to complete a full cross-comparison. Per ISO/IEC 19795, these comparisons will not be statistically independent, but this approach is statistically unbiased. Additionally, offline testing with a full cross-comparison greatly reduces the number of test subjects needed. If there are <htm:i>N<htm:sub>U</htm:sub></htm:i> users, the number of available individual independent comparisons will be <htm:i>N<htm:sub>U</htm:sub>*(N<htm:sub>U</htm:sub>-1)/2</htm:i>. Thus if the target <abbr linkend="FAR"/> is 1:10000, only 246 test subjects are needed if offline testing of a full cross-comparison is used.
        <htm:br/><htm:br/>
        
      </subsection>
   
      <subsection id="sub3" title="Deriving False Accept Rate">
        To expedite approval while maintaining a statistically valid result, it is required for the vendor 
        or independent lab to perform testing using <htm:i>three</htm:i> times the sample size, at a minimum, i.e. the “Rule of 3” for the number of trials. 
        <htm:br/><htm:br/>
        Three times the sample size corresponds to 90% confidence and <htm:i>c</htm:i> = 0.95 (rounded, worst-case), where <htm:i>c</htm:i> is a percentage/fraction of the intended false error rate (either <abbr linkend="FAR"/> or <abbr linkend="FRR"/>) for which the error bar is calculated. 
        <htm:br/><htm:br/>
        The parameters associated with the Rule of 3 are derived by treating a biometric test, consisting of many comparisons, as a series of Bernoulli trials. 
        <htm:br/><htm:br/>
        As shown in the tables below, the error bar may be large if a higher false error rate is declared. 
        <htm:br/><htm:br/>
        The table below assumes online testing using a single device, thus a single legitimate user.

    <section id="biometric2" title="Derivation of the Rule of 3 (and similar rules, for completeness)">
      A biometric test can be treated as a series of Bernoulli trials for which a binomial distribution of the number of successes and failures is assumed. When calculating an error interval for which a binomial distribution is assumed, one confidence interval (denoted <htm:i>I<htm:sub>conf</htm:sub></htm:i>) that is widely used is the standard Wald interval, expressed in Equation (1) as:
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      <htm:img src="images/equationI2-1.jpg" /> 
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      where <htm:i>p = X/n</htm:i> is the sample proportion of successes (or error in this case), 
      <htm:i>z<htm:sub>α/2</htm:sub></htm:i> is the 100(1 – α/2)th percentile of the standard normal distribution, 
      and <htm:i>n</htm:i> is the number of trials. 
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      Although intervals such as the Wilson, Agresti-Coull, and Jeffreys intervals 
      are recommended by Brown et al., biometrics testing in practice rests on the 
      derivation of the Rule of 30 based on the Wald distribution <cite linkend="Brown"/>. However, because of the large sample size, number of test subjects, and number of trials required for the Rule of 30, this PP mandates the Rule of 3 to make testing more feasible.
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      In simpler form, this refers to a confidence interval with error <htm:i>E</htm:i> expressed as:
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      <htm:img src="images/equationI2-2.jpg" />
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      Rearranging the equation to express the number of trials, <htm:i>n</htm:i>, in terms of error <htm:i>E</htm:i>, this expression becomes:
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      $$n=\left(\frac{z_{a/2}}{E}\right)^2p\left(1-p\right)\quad\quad(3)$$
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      In practice, <htm:i>E</htm:i> is expressed as a proportion of the error probability as:
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>

      <htm:i>E = cp             (4)</htm:i>
<!-- 
      $$E = cp\quad\quad(4)$$-->

      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      Thus, <htm:i>n</htm:i> finally becomes:
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      $$n=\left(\frac{z_{a/2}}{c}\right)^2\frac{\left(1-p\right)}{p}\quad\quad(5)$$
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      For a 90% confidence interval, <htm:i>z<htm:sub>α/2</htm:sub></htm:i> = 1.6449, while for a 95% 
      confidence interval, <htm:i>z<htm:sub>α/2</htm:sub></htm:i> = 1.96. 
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>

      Thus it is easy to see that for a 90% confidence interval with <htm:i>c</htm:i> = 0.95:
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> 
      <htm:img src="images/ruleOf3.jpg" />
<!-- Wrong equation, but kept for formatting reference -->
      <!--  $$\left ( \frac{1.6449}{0.3}\right )^{2}= 30.06\quad\quad(6)$$-->

      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      which confirms the rule of 3 and completes our derivation.
    </section>
    
    <section id="biometric3" title="SAFAR Calculation Equations">
      A number of equations can be used in calculating SAFAR. A fully-worked example that applies the equations below can be found in <appref linkend="biometric4"/>.
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      The SAFAR for a single authentication factor is calculated as <htm:img src="images/SAFAR_test.jpg"/>.
     
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      Thus let <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>i</htm:sub></htm:i> be the SAFAR for the <htm:i>i<htm:sup>th</htm:sup></htm:i> 
      authentication factor where <htm:i>n<htm:sub>i</htm:sub></htm:i> is the number of authentication attempts allowed for the given factor, treated individually as a separate authentication system, which can be expressed as 
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      <htm:img src="images/equationI3-1.jpg" />  (1)
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      assuming each attempt is independent.
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      If multiple authentication factors are required (with all to pass), i.e. password plus biometric factor, the SAFAR for a single attempt will be the product of each individual factor’s false accept rate, assuming each attempt is independent.
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      Thus, for a hybrid combination of <htm:i>m</htm:i> PIN/password and biometric factors (denoted 
      with index <htm:i>j</htm:i>) with <htm:i>n<htm:sub>i</htm:sub></htm:i> attempts allowed, 
      treated collectively as an individual authentication factor in a separate authentication system, the SAFAR can be expressed as:
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      <htm:img src="images/equationI3-2.jpg" />  (2)
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      assuming each attempt is independent. Because this is currently associated with a PIN/password and biometrics, <htm:i>m</htm:i> = 2 in this case. 
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      When ordered, let <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>(k)</htm:sub></htm:i> be the SAFAR for the authentication 
      factor with the largest SAFAR, and <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>(1)</htm:sub></htm:i> be the SAFAR for the 
      authentication factor with the smallest SAFAR, 
      i.e. <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>(1)</htm:sub></htm:i> ≤ <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>(s)</htm:sub></htm:i> ≤ …  ≤ <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>(k-1)</htm:sub></htm:i>  ≤ <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>(k)</htm:sub></htm:i>. 
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      As such, the following equations for SAFAR utilizing multiple factors follow (using the worst SAFARs):
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      If the user has a choice of multiple authentication factors with a choice of only one authentication factor in a given session (i.e. all authentication factors are considered critical and a user cannot switch between authentication factors), the overall SAFAR will be equal to <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>(k)</htm:sub></htm:i>, assuming each attempt is independent.
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      If the user has a choice of multiple authentication factors and can choose to attempt authentication using more than one factor with success requiring any factor to pass and <htm:i>n<htm:sub>i</htm:sub></htm:i> attempts allowed per factor) for a given session, the SAFAR for <htm:i>k</htm:i> available authentication factors will be
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      <htm:img src="images/equationI3-3.jpg" />  (3)
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      assuming each attempt is independent. If there are <htm:i>critical factors</htm:i>, the highest SAFAR corresponding to the <htm:i>worst-case</htm:i> set of choices shall be reported. 
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      If the user has the choice of a number of authentication factors from 
      which the user must choose <htm:i>m</htm:i> factors, all of which must pass with <htm:i>n</htm:i> attempts 
      per factor allowed, the SAFAR for a single combination of <htm:i>m</htm:i> factors will be 
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      <htm:img src="images/equationI3-4.jpg" />  (4)
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      assuming each attempt is independent. If <htm:i>m &lt; k</htm:i> available factors, the 
      worst-case of all <htm:img src="images/equationI3-a.jpg" /> combinations of factors becomes the overall SAFAR.

         </htm:li>
        <htm:li>
          If the user is only allowed to pick one factor, the overall SAFAR is that of the weakest one,

        <htm:li>
          If the user can authenticate using any authentication factor in an authentication session, the overall SAFAR is:<htm:br/>
          <htm:br/><htm:br/>
          <htm:img src="images/equationI4-d.jpg" />
          <htm:br/><htm:br/>
          <htm:img src="images/equationI4-e.jpg" />
        </htm:li>
        <htm:li>
          If the conditions are the same as in c) but with password as a critical factor, the worst-case scenario is the same as in c) in that the password factor is picked last, thus 
          <htm:br/><htm:br/>
          <htm:img src="images/equationI4-f.jpg" /> .
          </htm:li>
        <htm:li>
          If password and fingerprint are now required factors, the SAFAR for fingerprint has to be recalculated for ten attempts:
          <htm:br/><htm:br/>
          <htm:img src="images/equationI4-g.jpg" /> .
          <htm:br/><htm:br/>
          Since the SAFAR for password with ten attempts allowed is known, it then follows that:
          <htm:br/><htm:br/>
          <htm:img src="images/equationI4-h.jpg" />.
          The risk of providing authentication feedback is that if either authentication factor is compromised, the same sample can then be used by the adversary for every authentication after, thus reducing the SAFAR for the system to that of the other authentication factor.
          <htm:br/><htm:br/>
        </htm:li>
        <htm:li>
          If password/PIN and fingerprint are now combined into a single hybrid factor, the SAFAR is as follows:

          <htm:img src="images/equationI4-i.jpg" /> .
          <htm:br/><htm:br/>
          This is more secure than e) because not only are there less attempts overall before the maximum count is exceeded (10 instead of 20), the adversary would not know if a sample submitted for either factor results in authentication unless the presentation of both factors results in successful authentication.
