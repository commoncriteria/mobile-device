        Not sure if/how we want to communicate functional package guidance but this is our expectation for what claims can be made:
        <h:br/>
        TLS package:<h:br/>
        - TLS with mutual authentication is mandatory<h:br/>
        - DTLS with mutual authentication is optional<h:br/>
        Any other requirements can be specified freely<h:br/>
        FTP_ITC_EXT.1 doesn't currently specify client vs server but it's implied from context throughout the PP that only client is used
        <h:br/><h:br/>
        
        X.509 package:<h:br/>
        - FIA_XCU_EXT.2 must be claimed because the PP requires support for mutual authentication<h:br/>
        - the old PP specified PKCS10 and EST as objective requirements for obtaining certificates -
        with the new FP, FIA_X509_EXT.6 is selected because of FIA_XCU_EXT.2 claims (because the TOE will not have its own internal/embedded CA) but there is nothing forcing the specific enrollment method to be used. Right now this means any of PKCS10, EST, CMC, or CMP must be used. If the idea is to only permit PKCS10/EST, some way of communicating that must be applied.<h:br/>
        - FIA_X509_EXT.1 must be claimed (it was mandatory in the old PP). CRL or OCSP is expected as the only supported revocation methods. Specific additional guidance may be needed to limit the FIA_X509_EXT.1.3 selections to those values. SME input is needed as to whether any of the other selections in this component are mandatory or forbidden.<h:br/>
        - FIA_X509_EXT.2 must be claimed (it was mandatory in the old PP)<h:br/>
        
        Also, right now we don't make an explicit statement in FAU_GEN.1 that the corresponding audit events from the claimed functional package SFRs must also be added to the audit table. Do we need that or is it sufficiently implied?

The scope of this Protection Profile (PP) is to describe the security functionality of mobile devices in terms of [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for such devices.		
    </sec:Objectives_of_Document>
    <tech-terms>
      <term full="Address Space Layout Randomization" abbr="ASLR"> An anti-exploitation feature,
        which loads memory mappings into unpredictable locations. ASLR makes it more difficult for
        an attacker to redirect control to code that they have introduced into the address space of
        a process or the kernel.</term>
      <term full="Administrator"> The Administrator is responsible for management activities,
        including setting the policy that is applied by the enterprise on the Mobile Device. This
        administrator is likely to be acting remotely and could be the Mobile Device Management
        (MDM) Administrator acting through an MDM Agent. If the device is unenrolled, the user is
        the administrator.</term>
      <term full="Auxiliary Boot Modes"> Auxiliary boot modes are states in which the device
        provides power to one or more components to provide an interface that enables an
        unauthenticated user to interact with either a specific component or several components that
        exist outside of the device’s fully authenticated, operational state.</term>
      <term full="Biometric Authentication Factor" abbr="BAF"> Authentication factor, which uses
        biometric sample, matched to a biometric authentication template to help establish
        identity.</term>
      <term full="Common Application Developer"> Application developers (or software companies)
        often produce many applications under the same name. Mobile devices often allow shared
        resources by such applications where otherwise resources would not be shared. </term>
      <term full="Critical Security Parameter" abbr="CSP"> Security-related information whose
        disclosure or modification can compromise the security of a cryptographic module or
        authentication system. </term>
      <term full="Data"> Program/application or data files that are stored or transmitted by a
        server or Mobile Device (MD). </term>
      <term full="Data Encryption Key" abbr="DEK">A key used to encrypt data-at-rest.</term>
      <term full="Developer Modes"> Developer modes are states in which additional services are
        available to a user in order to provide enhanced system access for debugging of software. </term>
      <term full="Encrypted Software Keys"> These keys are stored in the main file system encrypted
        by another key and can be changed and sanitized.</term>
      <term full="Enrolled State"> The state in which the Mobile Device is managed with active
        policy settings from the administrator.</term>
      <term full="Enterprise Data"> Enterprise data is any data residing in the enterprise servers,
        or temporarily stored on Mobile Devices to which the Mobile Device user is allowed access
        according to security policy defined by the enterprise and implemented by the
        administrator.</term>
      <term full="Ephemeral Keys"> These keys are stored in volatile memory.</term>
      <term full="File Encryption Key" abbr="FEK"> A DEK used to encrypt a file or a director when
        File Encryption is used. FEKs are unique to each encrypted file or directory. </term>
      <term full="Hardware-Isolated Keys"> The OS can only access these keys by reference, if
        at all, during runtime. </term>
      <term full="Hybrid Authentication"> A hybrid authentication factor is one where a user has to
        submit a combination of a biometric sample and a PIN or password and both must pass. If either factor fails, the entire attempt fails. The user shall not be made aware of which factor failed, if either fails.</term>
      <term full="Immutable Hardware Key"> These keys are stored as hardware-protected raw key and
        cannot be changed or sanitized.</term>
      <term full="Key Chaining"> The method of using multiple layers of encryption keys to protect
        data. A top layer key encrypts a lower layer key, which encrypts the data; this method can
      have any number of layers.</term>
      <term full="Key Encryption Key" abbr="KEK"> A key used to encrypt other keys, such as DEKs or
        storage that contains keys.</term>
      <term full="Locked State"> Powered on but most functionality is unavailable for use. User
        authentication is required to access functionality.</term>
      <term full="Mobile Device" abbr="MD"> A device which is composed of a hardware platform and
        its system software. The device typically provides wireless connectivity and may include
        software for functions like secure messaging, email, web, VPN (Virtual Private Network) connection, and VoIP (Voice
        over IP), for access to the protected enterprise network, enterprise data and applications,
        and for communicating to other Mobile Devices. </term>
      <term full="Mobile Device Management" abbr="MDM"> Mobile device management (MDM) products
        allow enterprises to apply security policies to mobile devices. This system consists of two
        primary components: the MDM Server and the MDM Agent. </term>
      <term full="MDM Agent"> The MDM Agent is installed on a Mobile Device as an application or is
        part of the Mobile Device’s OS. The MDM Agent establishes a secure connection back to the
        MDM Server controlled by the administrator.</term>
      <term full="Minutia Point"> Friction ridge characteristics that are used to individualize a
        fingerprint image. Minutia are the points where friction ridges begin, terminate, or split
        into two or more ridges. In many fingerprint systems, the minutia points are compared for
        recognition purposes.</term>
      <term full="Mobile Device User"> The individual authorized to physically control and
        operate the Mobile Device. Depending on the use case, this can be the device owner or an
        individual authorized by the device owner.</term>
      <term full="Modality"> A type or class of biometric system, such as fingerprint
        recognition, facial recognition, iris recognition, voice recognition, signature/sign, and
        others.</term>
      <term full="Mutable Hardware Key"> These keys are stored as hardware-protected raw key and can
      be changed or sanitized.</term>
      <term full="Operating System" abbr="OS"> Software that runs at the highest privilege level
        and can directly control hardware resources. Modern Mobile Devices typically have at least
        two primary operating systems: one, which runs on the application processor and one,
        which runs on the cellular baseband processor. The OS of the application processor handles most
        user interactions and provides the execution environment for apps. The OS of the cellular
        baseband processor handles communications with the cellular network and may control other
        peripherals. The term OS, without context, may be assumed to refer to the OS of the
        application processor. </term>
      <term full="Password Authentication Factor"> A type of authentication factor requiring the
        user to provide a secret set of characters to gain access.</term>
      <term full="PIN Authentication Factor"> A PIN is a set of numeric or alphabetic characters that may be used
        in addition to a biometric factor to provide a hybrid authentication factor. At this time it
        is not considered as a stand-alone authentication mechanism. A PIN is distinct from a password in that the allowed character set and required length of a PIN
      is typically smaller than that of a password as it is designed to be input quickly.</term>
      <term full="Powered Off State"> The device has been shut down such that no TOE function can be
        performed.</term>
      <term full="Protected Data" abbr="PD"> Protected data is all non-TSF data, including all user
        or enterprise data. Some or all of this data may be considered sensitive data as well. </term>
      <term full="Root Encryption Key" abbr="REK"> A key tied to the device used to encrypt other
        keys. </term>
      <term full="Sensitive data"> Sensitive data shall be identified in the TSS section of the
        Security Target (ST) by the ST author. Sensitive data is a subset or all of the Protected
        data. Sensitive data may include all user or enterprise data or may be specific application
        data such as emails, messaging, documents, calendar items, and contacts. Sensitive data is
        protected while in the locked state (FDP_DAR_EXT.2). </term>
      <term full="Software Keys"> The OS access the raw bytes of these keys during runtime.</term>
      <term full="Trust Anchor Database"> A list of trusted root Certificate Authority
        certificates.</term>
      <term full="TSF Data"> Data for the operation of the TSF upon which the enforcement of the
        requirements relies.</term>
      <term full="Unenrolled State"> The state in which the Mobile Device is not managed. </term>
      <term full="Unlocked State"> Powered on and device functionality is available for use. Implies
        user authentication has occurred (when so configured).</term>
      <term full="Verification"> A task where the biometric system attempts to confirm
        an individual’s claimed identity by comparing a submitted sample to one or more previously
        enrolled authentication templates.</term>

      secure operation of applications on the device. Additional security features such as security
      policy enforcement, application mandatory access control, anti-exploitation features, user
      authentication, and software integrity protection are implemented in order to address threats.
      <h:br/><h:br/> This assurance standard describes these essential security services
      provided by the Mobile Device and serves as a foundation for a secure mobile architecture. The
      wireless connectivity shall be validated against the <xref to="mod-wlanclient"/>. If the
      mobile device contains Bluetooth functionality (i.e., has Bluetooth hardware), the Bluetooth
      connectivity shall be evaluated against the <xref to="mod-bluetooth"/>.
	  As illustrated in <xref to="TOE"/>, it is expected that a typical deployment would also include either
      third-party or bundled components. Whether these components are bundled as part of the Mobile
      Device by the manufacturer or developed by a third-party, they must be separately validated
      against the related assurance standards such as the PP-Module for MDM Agent, PP-Module for VPN
      Client, PP-Module for VVoIP, and cPP-Module for Biometrics. It is the responsibility of the architect of
      the overall secure mobile architecture to ensure validation of these components. Additional
      applications that may come pre-installed on the Mobile Device that are not validated are
      considered to be potentially flawed, but not malicious. Examples include email client and web
      browser. <h:br/><h:br/><figure entity="images/figure2.jpg" title="Optional Additional Mobile Device Components" id="TOE"/><h:br/></section>
    <sec:Use_Cases>
      <h:p>
        The Mobile Device may be operated in a number of use cases. 
        <xref g="use-case-appendix"/> provides use case templates that list those selections,
        assignments, and objective requirements that best support the use cases identified by this
        Protection Profile.
        In addition to providing essential security services, the Mobile Device
        includes the necessary security functionality to support configurations for these various use
        cases.
        Each use case may require additional configuration and applications to achieve the
        desired security.
        A selection of these use cases is elaborated below.
      </h:p> <h:p>
        Several of the use case templates include objective requirements that are strongly desired for
        the indicated use cases.
        Readers can expect those requirements to be made mandatory in a
        future revision of this protection profile, and industry should aim to include that security
        functionality in products in the near-term.
      </h:p> <h:p> 
        As of publication of this version of the Protection Profile, meeting the requirements in 
        <xref to="Security_Requirements"/> is necessary for all use cases.

          <description><h:br/> 
          An enterprise-owned device for general-purpose business use is commonly
          called <h:i>Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE)</h:i>.
          This use case entails a significant degree of enterprise control over configuration 
          and, possibly, software inventory.
          The enterprise elects to provide users with Mobile Devices and additional applications (such as
          VPN or email clients) in order to maintain control of their Enterprise data and security of
          their networks.
          Users may use Internet connectivity to browse the web or access corporate mail
          or run enterprise applications, but this connectivity may be under significant control of the
          enterprise.

          <description><h:br/>
     An enterprise-owned device with intentionally limited network connectivity, tightly controlled configuration, and limited software inventory is appropriate for specialized, high-security use cases. For example, the device may not be permitted connectivity to any external peripherals. It may only be able to communicate via its Wi-Fi or cellular radios with the enterprise-run network, which may not even permit connectivity to the Internet. Use of the device may entail compliance with policies that are more restrictive than those in any general-purpose use case, yet may mitigate risks to highly sensitive information. As in the previous case, the enterprise will look for additional applications providing enterprise connectivity and services to have a similar level of assurance as the platform.

          <description><h:br/>
        A personally-owned device that is used for both personal activities and enterprise data is commonly called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). The device may be provisioned for access to enterprise resources after significant personal usage has occurred. Unlike in the enterprise-owned cases, the enterprise is limited in what security policies it can enforce because the user purchased the device primarily for personal use and is unlikely to accept policies that limit the functionality of the device. However, because the enterprise allows the user full (or nearly full) access to the enterprise network, the enterprise will require their own security controls to ensure that enterprise resources are protected from potential threats posed by the personal activities on the device. These controls could potentially be enforced by a separation mechanism built-in to the device itself to distinguish between enterprise and personal activities, or by a third-party application that provides access to enterprise resources and leverages security capabilities provided by the mobile device. Based upon the operational environment and the acceptable risk level of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in <xref to="Security_Requirements"/> of this PP along with the selections in the Use Case 3 template defined in Appendix F - Use Case Templates are sufficient for the secure implementation of this BYOD use case.

          A personally-owned device that is used for both personal activities and enterprise data is commonly called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). This device may be provisioned for limited access to enterprise resources such as enterprise email. Because the user does not have full access to the enterprise or enterprise data, the enterprise may not need to enforce any security policies on the device. However, the enterprise may want secure email and web browsing with assurance that the services being provided to those clients by the Mobile Device are not compromised. Based upon the operational environment and the acceptable risk level of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in Section 5 Security Requirements of this PP are sufficient for the secure implementation of this BYOD use case.

    <!-- 3.1 Threats -->
    <sec:Threats> Mobile devices are subject to the threats of traditional
      computer systems along with those entailed by their mobile nature. The threats considered in
      this PP are those of network eavesdropping, network attacks, physical access,
      malicious or flawed applications, persistent presence, and backup
      as
      detailed in the following sections. 
      <threats><threat name="T.MALICIOUS_APP"><description> Applications loaded onto the Mobile Device may include malicious or            exploitable code. This code could be included intentionally or unknowingly by the            developer, perhaps as part of a software library. Malicious apps may attempt to            exfiltrate data to which they have access. They may also conduct attacks against the            platform’s system software, which will provide them with additional privileges and the            ability to conduct further malicious activities. Malicious applications may be able to            control the device's sensors (GPS, camera, microphone) to gather intelligence about the            user's surroundings even when those activities do not involve data resident or            transmitted from the device. Flawed applications may give an attacker access to perform            network-based or physical attacks that otherwise would have been prevented.</description><!-- New mapping to build updated threat

      <section id="fcs" title="Class: Cryptographic Support (FCS)">
         
        This section describes how keys are generated, derived, combined, released and destroyed. There are two major types of keys: DEKs and KEKs. (A REK is considered a KEK.)
         DEKs are used to protect data (as in the DAR protection described in FDP_DAR_EXT.1 and FDP_DAR_EXT.2). KEKs are used to protect other keys – DEKs, other KEKs, and other types of keys stored by the user or applications.
         The following diagram shows an example key hierarchy to illustrate the concepts of this profile. 
         This example is not meant as an approved design, but ST authors will be expected to provide a diagram illustrating their key hierarchy in order to demonstrate that they meet the requirements of this profile. 
         Please note if <xref to="uau_biometric"/> is selected in FIA_UAU.5.1, each BAF claimed in FIA_MBV_EXT.1.1 in the <xref to="mod-biometrics"/> shall be illustrated in the key hierarchy diagram, to include a description of when and how the BAF is used to release keys.
	 If <xref to="uau_hybr"/> is selected in FIA_UAU.5.1, meaning that a PIN or password must be used in conjunction with the BAF, this interaction shall be included.<h:br/><figure entity="images/figure3.jpg" title="An Illustrative Key Hierarchy" id="Keys"/>

These validation tests for each key agreement scheme verify that a TOE has implemented the components of the key agreement scheme according to the specifications in the Recommendation. These components include the calculation of the DLC primitives (the shared secret value Z) and the calculation of the derived keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function (KDF). If key confirmation is supported, the evaluator shall also verify that the components of key confirmation have been implemented correctly, using the test procedures described below.

For each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type, and, if supported, key confirmation role- key confirmation type combination, the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors.

To conduct this test, the evaluator shall obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A Revision 3 key agreement implementation to determine which errors the TOE should be able to recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24 (FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors consisting of data sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves, the evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s public/private key pairs, MacTag, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the other info and TOE id fields. <h:br/> <h:br/>The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being incorrect: the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the data to be MACed, or the generated MacTag. If the TOE contains the full or partial (only ECC) public key validation, the evaluator will also individually inject errors in both parties’ static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the TOE’s static private key to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key validation function or the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test vectors shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results (they should pass). <h:br/> <h:br/>The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme using the corresponding parameters.

Each test vector shall include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any additional input parameters if applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the evaluator shall perform a key establishment encryption operation on the TOE with the same inputs (in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the test shall use the MacKey from the test vector instead of the randomly generated MacKey used in normal operation) and ensure that the outputted ciphertext is equivalent to the ciphertext in the test vector. <h:br/> <h:br/>If the TOE acts as a receiver, the following evaluation activities shall be performed to ensure the proper operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based key establishment scheme: <h:br/>To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors FCS_CKM.2.1/LOCKED from a known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of supported key establishment scheme and its options (with our without key confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test vector shall include the RSA private key, the plaintext keying material (KeyData), any additional input parameters if applicable, the MacTag in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the evaluator shall perform the key establishment decryption operation on the TOE and ensure that the outputted plaintext keying material (KeyData) is equivalent to the plaintext keying material in the test vector. In cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the evaluator shall perform the key confirmation steps and ensure that the outputted MacTag is equivalent to the MacTag in the test vector. <h:br/> <h:br/>The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the TOE handles decryption errors. In accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-56B, the TOE must not reveal the particular error that occurred, either through the contents of any outputted or logged error message or through timing variations. If KTS-OAEP is supported, the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext values that trigger each of the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special Publication 800-56B section 7.2.2.3, ensure that each decryption attempt results in an error, and ensure that any outputted or logged error message is identical for each. If KTS-KEM-KWS is supported, the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext values that trigger each of the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special Publication 800-56B section 7.2.3.3, ensure that each decryption attempt results in an error, and ensure that any outputted or logged error message is identical for each. <h:br/> <h:br/> <h:b>RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 Key Establishment Schemes</h:b> <h:br/>The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF's implementation of RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 by using a known good implementation for each protocol selected in FTP_ITC_EXT.1 that uses RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5. <h:b>FFC Schemes using "safe-prime" groups</h:b> <h:br/>The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF's implementation of "safe-prime" groups by using a known good implementation for each protocol selected in FTP_ITC_EXT.1 that uses "safe-prime" groups.

              strength corresponding to FCS_CKM.1. <h:br/><h:br/>

	      The raw key material of

              cannot access the raw key material. Thus if <xref to="s-immutable-hardware"/>
	      is selected in
              FCS_CKM_EXT.1.1 it implicitly meets FCS_CKM_EXT.7.

	      The
              lack of a public/documented API for importing or exporting the REK, when a

              from a Password Authentication Factor, and KEK_2 is combined from two KEKs. In <xref to="Keys"/>, KEK_3 may either be a symmetric key generated from an RBG or an
              asymmetric key generated using a key generation scheme according to FCS_CKM.1.
              <h:br/><h:br/> If combined, the ST author should describe which method of
              combination is used in order to justify that the effective entropy of each factor is
              preserved. <h:br/><h:br/>SP 800-56C specifies a two-step key derivation procedure that
              employs an extraction-then-expansion technique for deriving keying material from a
              shared secret generated during a key establishment scheme. The Randomness Extraction
              step as described in Section 5 of SP 800-56C is followed by Key Expansion using the
              key derivation functions defined in SP 800-108 (as described in Section 6 of SP

This result shall be compared to the result of running 1000 iterations with the same values using a known good implementation. <h:br/><h:br/>  <h:br/><h:br/> The evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality using the same test as for encrypt, exchanging CT and PT and replacing AES-CBC-Encrypt with AES-CBC-Decrypt.</test>

            <note role="application">Per NIST SP 800-131A, SHA-1 for generating digital signatures
              is no longer allowed, and SHA-1 for verification of digital signatures is strongly
              discouraged as there may be risk in accepting these signatures. It is expected that
              vendors will implement SHA-2 algorithms in accordance with SP
              800-131A.<h:br/><h:br/>The intent of this requirement is to specify the hashing
              function. The hash selection must support the message digest size selection. The hash
              selection should be consistent with the overall strength of the algorithm used (for
              example, SHA-384 for 256-bit keys). <h:br/><h:br/> The TSF hashing functions can
              be implemented in one of two modes. The first mode is the byte­oriented mode. In this
              mode the TSF only hashes messages that are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e.
              the length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is
              the bit­oriented mode. In this mode the TSF hashes messages of arbitrary length. The
              TSF may implement either bit-oriented or byte-oriented; both implementations are not

              This requirement is claimed when a DRBG is seeded with entropy from one or more noise source that is outside the TOE boundary. In the case of a mobile device this would likely only occur when the entropy source is a Dedicated Security Component that is integrated with the TOE. Typically the entropy produced by an environmental noise source is conditioned such that the input length has full entropy and is therefore usable as the seed. However, if this is not the case, it should be noted what the minimum entropy rate of the noise source is so that the TSF can collect a sufficiently large sample of noise data to be conditioned into a seed value.

      <section id="fdp" title="Class: User Data Protection (FDP)">
        <h:p>
	    A subset of the User Data Protection focuses on protecting Data-At-Rest, namely FDP_DAR_EXT.1 and FDP_DAR_EXT.2.
            Three levels of data-at-rest protection are addressed: TSF data, Protected Data (and keys), and sensitive data.
	    <xref to="datalevels"/> addresses the level of protection required for each level of data-at-rest.
	  </h:p> <h:b><ctr id="datalevels" ctr-type="Table">: Protection of Data Levels</ctr></h:b><h:br/><h:br/><h:table><h:tr class="header"><h:td>Data Level</h:td><h:td>Protection Required</h:td></h:tr><h:tr><h:td>TSF Data</h:td><h:td>TSF data does not require confidentiality, but does require integrity protection. (FPT_TST_EXT.2/PREKERNEL)</h:td></h:tr><h:tr><h:td>Protected Data</h:td><h:td>Protected data is encrypted while powered off. (FDP_DAR_EXT.1)</h:td></h:tr><h:tr><h:td>Sensitive Data</h:td><h:td>Sensitive data is encrypted while in the locked state, in addition to while powered off. (FDP_DAR_EXT.2)</h:td></h:tr></h:table><h:br/> 
          All keys, protected data, and sensitive data must ultimately be protected by the REK. Sensitive data must be protected by the password in addition to the REK. In particular, <xref to="Keys"/> has KEKs protected according to these requirements: DEK_1 would be appropriate for sensitive data, DEK_2 would not be appropriate for sensitive data, K_1 is not considered a sensitive key, and K_2 is considered a sensitive key. <h:br/><h:br/> 
          These requirements include a capability for encrypting sensitive data received while in the locked state, which may be considered a separate sub-category of sensitive data. This capability may be met by a key transport scheme (RSA) by using a public key to encrypt the DEK while protecting the corresponding private key with a password-derived or biometric-unlocked KEK. <h:br/><h:br/> 
          This capability may also be met by a key agreement scheme. To do so, the device generates a device-wide sensitive data asymmetric pair (the private key of which is protected by a password-derived or biometric-unlocked KEK) and an asymmetric pair for the received sensitive data to be stored. In order to store the sensitive data, the device-wide public key and data private key are used to generate a shared secret, which can be used as a KEK or a DEK. The data private key and shared secret are cleared after the data is encrypted and the data public key stored. Thus, no key material is available in the locked state to decrypt the newly stored data. Upon unlock, the device-wide private key is decrypted and is used with each data public key to regenerate the shared secret and decrypt the stored data.
	  <xref to="KeysLocked"/>, below, illustrates this scheme. <h:br/><h:br/><figure id="KeysLocked" entity="images/figure4.jpg" title="Key Agreement Scheme for Encrypting Received Sensitive Data in the Locked State"/><h:br/><h:br/>

The evaluator shall exercise the TSF configuration as the administrator and, if not restricted to the administrator, the user, to enable and disable the state of each radio (e.g. Wi-Fi, cellular, NFC, Bluetooth). Additionally, the evaluator shall repeat the steps below, booting into any auxiliary boot mode supported by the device. For each radio, the evaluator shall: <h:br/> <h:br/>Step 1: Place the antenna of the spectrum analyzer inside the RF shielded enclosure. Configure the spectrum analyzer to sweep desired frequency range for the radio to be tested (based on range provided in the TSS)). The ambient noise floor shall be set to -110 dBm. Place the TOE into the RF shielded enclosure to isolate them from all other RF traffic. <h:br/> <h:br/>Step 2: The evaluator shall create a baseline of the expected behavior of RF signals. The evaluator shall power on the device, ensure the radio in question is enabled, power off the device, enable "Max Hold" on the spectrum analyzer and power on the device. The evaluator shall wait 2 minutes at each Authentication Factor interface prior to entering the necessary password to complete the boot process, waiting 5 minutes after the device is fully booted. The evaluator shall observe that RF spikes are present at the expected uplink channel frequency. The evaluator shall clear the "Max Hold" on the spectrum analyzer. <h:br/> <h:br/>Step 3: The evaluator shall verify the absence of RF activity for the uplink channel when the radio in question is disabled. The evaluator shall complete the following test five times. The evaluator shall power on the device, ensure the radio in question is disabled, power off the device, enable "Max Hold" on the spectrum analyzer and power on the device. The evaluator shall wait 2 minutes at each Authentication Factor interface prior to entering the necessary password to complete the boot process, waiting 5 minutes after the device is fully booted. The evaluator shall clear the "Max Hold" on the spectrum analyzer. If the radios are used for device initialization, then a spike of RF activity for the uplink channel can be observed initially at device boot. However, if a spike of RF activity for the uplink channel of the specific radio frequency band is observed after the device is fully booted or at an Authentication Factor interface it is deemed that the radio is enabled.</Tests>

              to be implemented. The ST author should select which Optional functions are
              implemented. <h:br/><h:br/> The fourth column ("User Only") indicates functions
              that are to be restricted to the user (i.e. not available to the administrator).
              <h:br/><h:br/> The fifth column ("Admin") indicates functions that are
              available to the administrator. The functions restricted to the user (column 4) cannot
              also be available to the administrator. Functions available to the administrator can
              still be available to the user, as long as the function is not restricted to the
              administrator (column 6). Thus, if the TOE must offer these functions to the
              administrator to perform, the fifth column must be selected. <h:br/><h:br/> The
              sixth column (FMT_MOF_EXT.1.2) indicates whether the function is to be restricted to
              the administrator when the device is enrolled and the administrator applies the
              indicated policy. If the function is restricted to the administrator the function is
              not available to the user. This does not prevent the user from modifying a setting to
              make the function stricter, but the user cannot undo the configuration enforced by the
              administrator. <h:br/><h:br/> The ST author may use a table in the ST, listing

              sub-functions not in a selection are also mandatory and any assignments must contain
              at least one assigned value. For functions that are optional and contain an assignment
              or selection, at least one value must be assigned/selected to be included in the ST.
              For non-selectable sub-functions in an optional function, all sub-functions must be
              implemented in order for the function to be included. For functions with a "per-app
              basis" sub function and an assignment, the ST author must indicate which assigned
              features are manageable on a per-app basis and which are not by iterating the row.

              actions that TOE may provide (perhaps via APIs) to the administrator (perhaps via an MDM
              agent) that may be performed upon unenrollment. "Enterprise applications" refers to
              applications that are in the Enterprise application group. "Enterprise resource data"
              refers to all stored Enterprise data and the separate resources that are available to
              the Enterprise application group, per FDP_ACF_EXT.2.1. If FDP_ACF_EXT.2.1 is included
              in the ST, then "remove all device-stored Enterprise resource data" must be selected,
              and is defined to be all resources selected in FDP_ACF_EXT.2.1. If FIA_UAU_EXT.4.1 is
              included in the ST, then "remove Enterprise secondary authentication data" must be
              selected. If FIA_UAU_EXT.4.1 is not included in the ST, then "remove Enterprise
              secondary authentication data" cannot be selected. Enterprise secondary authentication
              data only refers to any data stored on the TOE that is specifically used as part of a
              secondary authentication mechanism to authenticate access to Enterprise applications
              and shared resources. Material that is used for the TOE’s primary authentication
              mechanism or other purposes not related to authentication to or protection of

              Protected data is all non-TSF data, including all user or enterprise data. Some or all
              of this data may be considered sensitive data as well.
			  If <xref to="s-smf-wipe-pro"/> is selected it is assumed that the sensitive data is wiped as well.
			  However, if <xref to="s-smf-wipe-sen"/> is selected, it does not imply that all non-TSF data (protected data)
              is wiped.
			  If <xref to="s-smf-wipe-pro"/> or <xref to="s-smf-wipe-sen"/> is selected the wipe  must be in accordance with FCS_CKM_EXT.5.1.
			  Thus cryptographically wiping the device is an acceptable remediation action.

      The Security Objectives in <xref to="Security_Objectives"/> 
      were constructed to address threats identified in
      <xref to="Security_Problem_Description"/>.
      The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) in <xref to="sfr"/> are a formal
      instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP identifies the Security Assurance
      Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation
      applicable for the evaluation and performs independent testing.<h:br/><h:br/> This section
      lists the set of SARs from CC part 3 that are required in evaluations against this PP.
      Individual Evaluation Activities to be performed are specified both in <xref to="sfr"/>
      as well as in this section. <h:br/><h:br/> The general model for evaluation of TOEs
      against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows:<h:br/><h:br/> After the ST has
      been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF will obtain the
      TOE, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for the TOE. The ITSEF is
      expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) for the ASE
      and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Evaluation Activities contained within <xref to="sfr"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM evaluation
      requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the TOE. The Evaluation
      Activities that are captured in <xref to="sfr"/> also provide clarification as to what
      the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the TOE is compliant with the PP.

         Testing is specified for functional aspects of

        The former is done through the ATE_IND family, while the latter is through the AVA_VAN
        family. At the assurance level specified in this PP, testing is based on advertised
        functionality and interfaces with dependency on the availability of design information. One
        of the primary outputs of the evaluation process is the test report as specified in the
        following requirements. <h:br/><h:br/> Since many of the APIs are not exposed at the
        user interface (e.g., touch screen), the ability to stimulate the necessary interfaces
        requires a developer’s test environment. This test environment will allow the evaluator, for
        example, to access APIs and view file system information that is not available on consumer
        Mobile Devices.

              aspects of the system. The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in
              the <xref to="CEM"/> and the body of this PP’s Evaluation Activities. While it is
              not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an evaluation activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the ST is covered. <h:br/><h:br/> The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the ST,
              the test plan provides a justification for not testing the platforms. This
              justification must address the differences between the tested platforms and the
              untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not affect the
              testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the differences
              have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in the ST are
              tested, then no rationale is necessary. <h:br/><h:br/> The test plan describes the
              composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is necessary beyond what
              is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that the evaluator is
              expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup of each platform
              either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This may include special
              test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not just an assertion)
              should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely affect the performance
              of the functionality by the TOE and its platform. This also includes the configuration
              of the cryptographic engine to be used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by
              this engine are those specified by this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols
              being evaluated (IPsec, TLS/HTTPS, SSH). <h:br/><h:br/> The test plan identifies
              high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be followed to achieve
              those objectives. These procedures include expected results. The test report (which
              could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details the activities that took
              place when the test procedures were executed, and includes the actual results of the
              tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a test run that resulted in
              a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of the test, the report would
              show a "fail" and "pass" result (and the supporting details), and not just the "pass"
              result.</aactivity>

    justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation is not required to
    be part of the TSS. 
    <section id="description" title="Design Description">
      Documentation shall
      include the design of the entropy source as a whole, including the interaction of all entropy
      source components. It will describe the operation of the entropy source to include how it
      works, how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the
      entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source
      design indicating where the random comes from, where it is passed next, any post-processing of
      the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how it is output from
      the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking) should also be
      described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.
      <h:br/><h:br/> This design must also include a description of the content of the security
      boundary of the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an
      adversary outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate. <h:br/><h:br/> If

      entropy source exhibiting probabilistic behavior (an explanation of the probability
      distribution and justification for that distribution given the particular source is one way to
      describe this). This argument will include a description of the expected entropy rate and
      explain how you ensure that sufficient entropy is going into the TOE randomizer seeding
      process. This discussion will be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be
      relied upon to produce bits with entropy. <h:br/><h:br/> The entropy justification shall

      of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. It
      will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the
      entropy source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall
