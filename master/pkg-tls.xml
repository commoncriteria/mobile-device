  <sec:Introduction>
    <sec:Overview>
      <h:p>      
	  Transport Layer Security (TLS) and the closely-related Datagram TLS (DTLS) are
    cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over IP networks.
    Several versions of the protocol are in widespread use in software that provides functionality
    such as web browsing, email, instant messaging, and voice-over-IP (VoIP).
    Major websites use TLS to protect communications to and from their servers.
    TLS is also used to protect communications between
    hosts and network infrastructure devices for administration.
    The underlying platform, such as an operating system, often provides the
    actual TLS implementation.
    The primary goal of the TLS protocol is to
    provide confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted
    between two communicating endpoints, as well as authentication of at least
    the server endpoint.
    </h:p><h:p>
	  TLS supports many different methods for exchanging keys, encrypting data,
	  and authenticating message integrity. These methods are dynamically negotiated
    between the client and server when the TLS connection is established.
    As a result, evaluating the implementation of both endpoints is typically
    necessary to provide assurance for the operating environment.
    </h:p><h:p>
	  This "Functional Package for Transport Layer Security" (short name "TLS-PKG")
    defines functional requirements for the implementation of the TLS
    and DTLS protocols. The requirements are
    intended to improve the security of products by enabling their evaluation.

                </h:p><h:p>
                Tests for TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 include examination of the handshake messages and behavior of the TSF when presented with unexpected or invalid messages. 
                For TLS 1.2 and below, previous versions of this Functional Package only required visibility of network traffic and the ability to modify a valid handshake message sent to the TSF.
                </h:p><h:p>
                <figure entity="images/figure2.png" title="Test environment for TLS 1.2 using network traffic visibility and control tools" id="Figure2"/>
                </h:p><h:p>
                TLS 1.3 introduces the encryption of handshake messages subsequent to the server hello exchange which prevents visibility and control using midpoint capabilities. 
                To achieve equivalent validation of TLS 1.3 requires the ability to modify the traffic underlying the encryption applied after the server hello message. 
                This can be achieved by introducing additional control of the messages sent, and visibility of messages received by the test TLS client, 
                (when validating TLS server functionality) or the test server (when validating TLS client functionality).
                </h:p><h:p>
                <figure entity="images/figure3.png" title="Test environment for TLS 1.3 using custom endpoint capabilities for visibility and control" id="Figure3"/>
                </h:p><h:p>
                Typically, a compliant TLS 1.3 library modified to provide visibility and control of the handshake messages prior to encryption suffices for all tests. 
                Such modification will require the test client, test server, or both to be validated. 
                </h:p><h:p>
                Since validations of products supporting only TLS 1.2 are still expected under this Package, 
                the test environment for TLS 1.2-only validations may include network sniffers and man-in-the-middle products that do not require such 
                modifications to a compliant TLS 1.2 library. 
                For consistency, a compliant TLS client (or TLS server) together with the network sniffers and man-in-the-middle capabilities 
                will also be referred to as a test TLS client (or test TLS server, respectively) in the following evaluation activities.

        This is claimed when both DTLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.2 are supported and the client uses the method to reject downgrade. Note that TLS 1.1
        or below downgrade protection in DTLS is used to notify a client that the server is capable of supporting DTLS 1.2 or DTLS 1.3, when
        it negotiates a DTLS 1.0 session because it received a client hello indicating maximum support for DTLS 1.0 (there is no DTLS version 1.1).
        Since this FP does not allow negotiation of DTLS 1.0, it is not necessary to claim such support.

        All supported methods for matching names are claimed.
        </h:p>
        <h:p>
          The rules for verification of identity are described in Section 6 of RFC 6125 and Section 7 of RFC 5280. If "common name conversion"
          is claimed, both the subject field and the converted common name are matched. The reference identifier is established by the user
          (e.g., entering a URL into a web browser or clicking a link), by configuration (e.g., configuring the name of a mail or 
          authentication server), or by an application (e.g., a parameter of an API) depending on the supported function. The client 
          establishes all acceptable reference identifiers for matching against the presented identifiers as validated in the server’s
          certificate. If the TSF performs matching of the reference identifiers to the identifiers provided in the server’s certificate, the
          first option is claimed and all supported name types are claimed. If the TSF presents the certificate, or the presented identifiers
          from the certificate to the supported function, the second option is claimed. If the TSF constructs initial name constraints
          derived from the reference identifiers for validation during certification path validation, the third option is claimed.
        </h:p>
        <h:p>
          In most cases where DTLS servers are represented by DNS-type names, the preferred method for verification is the Subject Alternative
          Name using DNS, URI, or Service Names. Verification using a conversion of the Common Name relative distinguished name from a DNS
          name type in the subject field is allowed for the purposes of backward compatibility.
        </h:p>
        <h:p>
          The client should avoid constructing reference identifiers using wildcards. However, if the presented identifiers include wildcards,
          the client must follow the best practices regarding matching; these best practices are captured in the evaluation activity. If the
          TSF supports wildcards and allows names with DNS portions containing internationalized names, the internationalized name should not
          match any wildcard, in accordance with RFC 6125 section 7.2.
        </h:p>
        <h:p>
          Support for other name types is rare, but may be claimed for specific applications. If specified, the assignment includes both the
          RFC describing normalization and matching rules and any refinements necessary to resolve options available in the RFC.

          The option “except when…” is claimed if DTLS specific exception rules are implemented to allow server certificates with no valid

          Note that FIA_X509_EXT.1 may allow methods other than CRL or OCSP to validate the revocation status of a certificate. A

          certificate that is valid according to FIA_X509_EXT.1 and does not advertise revocation status information in a CRL_DP or AIA
          extension is considered to be not revoked. DTLS-specific override mechanisms are for use with certificates with published
          revocation status information that is not accessible, whether temporarily or because the information cannot be accessed during the
          state of the TOE (e.g., for verifying signatures on boot code). The circumstances should be described by the ST author, who should

          <h:p>
            The evaluator shall check the description of the implementation of this protocol in the TSS to ensure the supported DTLS versions,
            features, ciphersuites, and extensions are specified in accordance with RFC 6347 (DTLS 1.2) and RFC 9147 (DTLS 1.3 and updates to
            DTLS 1.2) and as refined in FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1 as appropriate. 
          </h:p>
          <h:p>
            The evaluator shall verify that ciphersuites indicated in FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.2 are included in the description, and that none of the
            following ciphersuites are supported: ciphersuites indicating NULL, RC2, RC4, DES, IDEA, TDES, or AES-128 in the encryption
            algorithm component, indicating 'anon,' or indicating MD5 or SHA in the message digest algorithm component.
          </h:p>
          <h:p>
            The evaluator shall verify that the DTLS implementation description includes the extensions as required in FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.4.
          </h:p>
          <h:p>
            The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes applications that use the DTLS functions and how they establish reference
            identifiers.
          </h:p>
          <h:p>
            If name matching is supported, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS includes a description of matching methods used for each
            supported name type to the supported application defined reference identifiers. The evaluator shall verify that the TSS includes a
            description of wildcards recognized for each name type claimed in FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.5 and shall verify that the matching rules meet
            or exceed best practices. In particular, the evaluator shall ensure that the matching rules are as restrictive as, or more
            restrictive than the following: 
            <h:ul>
              <h:li>DNS names: The ‘*’ character used in the complete leftmost label of a DNS name represents any valid name that has the
                same number of labels, and that matches all remaining labels. The ‘*’ character must only be used in the leftmost complete
                label of a properly formatted DNS name. The ‘*’ must not be used to represent a public suffix, or in the leftmost label
                immediately following a public suffix. </h:li>
              <h:li>URI or SRV names: The ‘*’ character can only occur in the domain name portion of the name represented as a DNS name. All
                restrictions for wildcards in DNS names apply to the DNS portion of the name. URI host names presented as an IP address are
                matched according to IP address matching rules – see best practices for IP addresses below. In accordance with RFC 6125, it
                is preferred that such URIs are presented a matching name of type IP address in the SAN.</h:li>
              <h:li>IP addresses: RFC 5280 does not support IP address ranges as presented names, but indicates that presented names may be
                compared to IP address ranges present in name constraints. If the TSF supports IP address ranges as reference identifiers,
                the reference identifier matches if the presented name is in the range. IP ranges in name constraints (including reference
                identifiers) should be presented in CIDR format. </h:li>
              <h:li>RFC 2822 names: RFC 5280 and updates RFC 8398 and RFC 8399 do not support special indicators representing more that a 
                a single mailbox as a presented name, but indicates that presented names may be compared to a single mailbox, ‘any’ email
                address at a host, or ‘any’ email address on a domain (e.g., “example.com” matches any email address on the host example.com
                and “.example.com” matches any email address in the domain example.com, but does not match email addresses at the host
                “example.com”). Such matching is prohibited for internationalized RFC 2822 names.</h:li>
              <h:li>Embedded CN name types: The CN relative distinguished name of a DNS name type included in the subject field is not
                strongly typed. Attempts to match both the name type and wildcard specifications can result in matches not intended, and
                therefore, not authoritatively asserted by a certification authority. It is preferred that no matching of CN embedded names
                be supported, but if necessary for backward compatibility, the description should clearly indicate how different name types
                are interpreted in the matching algorithm. If an embedded CN is present, the DN structure containing the CN as an RDN is
                matched, and the CN component is further matched according to the specific rules for the implied name type. In particular,
                the ‘*’ character in a CN is not to be interpreted as representing more than a single entity unless the entirety of the RDN
                is properly formatted as a DNS, URI, or SVR name, and represents a wildcard meeting best practices as described above.</h:li>
            </h:ul>
          </h:p>
          <h:p>
            If name types are passed to the supported functions, the evaluator shall verify that for each claimed supported function, the TSS includes a description of the information used to validate the identifier that is passed to that function. 
          </h:p>
          <h:p>
            If name constraints are passed to the certificate verification function, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes the
            initial allow and deny tables for each reference identity reference name supported.
          </h:p>
          <h:p>        
            The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes how the DTLS client IP address is validated prior to issuing a server hello
            message.
          </h:p>
            The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes the actions that take place if a message received from the DTLS server fails
            the integrity check. If both selections are chosen in FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.7, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes when
            each method is used and whether the behavior is configurable. 
        </TSS>
        <Guidance>
          <h:p>
            The evaluator shall check the operational guidance to ensure that it contains instructions on configuring the product so that
            DTLS conforms to the description in the TSS and that it includes any instructions on configuring the version, ciphersuites, or
            optional extensions that are supported.
          </h:p>
          <h:p>
            The evaluator shall verify that all configurable features for matching identifiers in certificates presented in the DTLS
            handshake to application specific reference identifiers are described.
          </h:p>
          <h:p>
            If the TSS indicates the behavior of the TSF on receiving a message from the DTLS server that fails the MAC integrity check is
            configurable, the evaluator shall verify that the guidance documentation describes instructions for configuring the behavior.
          </h:p>
        </Guidance>
        <Tests>
          The evaluator shall perform the following tests.

                  supported, this field is required to indicate DTLS 1.2. If the TOE supports both DTLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.3, the client hello
                  should indicate all ciphersuites and all extensions as required for either version. In particular, the supported versions
                  extension is required and must include the DTLS 1.3 value ('fe fc') and may also include the DTLS 1.2 indicator ('fe fd').

                  It is sufficient to observe the successful negotiation of a ciphersuite to satisfy the intent of the test; it is not

                The evaluator shall perform the following tests to confirm the response to downgrade indicators from a test DTLS 1.3 server:
                <testlist>
                  <test>[conditional] If the TSF supports DTLS 1.3, the evaluator shall initiate a DTLS 1.3 session with a test DTLS 1.3 server 
                    configured to send a compliant DTLS 1.2 server hello (not including any DTLS 1.3 extensions) 
                    but including the DTLS 1.2 downgrade indicator ‘44 4F 57 4E 47 52 44 01’ in the last eight bytes of the server random field. 
                    The evaluator shall confirm that the TSF silently drops the server hello message or terminates the session.
                    <h:p>  
                      <h:b>Note:</h:b> If the TSF terminates the session, the test is successful. If the TSF silently drops the message,
                      the evaluator shall continue sending the server message until the TSF times out. It is preferred that the TSF logs
                      a fatal error alert message (e.g., illegal parameter), but it is acceptable that the TSF terminate the session 
                      without logging an error alert.
                    </h:p></test>
                  <test>[conditional] If the TSF supports the TLS 1.1 or below downgrade indicator to prevent downgrade to DTLS 1.0, and if the ST indicates a configuration where the indicator is processed, 
                    the evaluator shall follow operational guidance instructions to configure the TSF so it parses a DTLS 1.1 server hello message to detect and process the TLS downgrade indicator. 
                    The evaluator shall initiate a DTLS session between the TOE and a test DTLS server that is configured to send a DTLS 1.0 server hello message 
                    with the downgrade indicator ‘44 4F 57 4E 47 52 44 00’ in the last eight bytes of the server random field, 
                    but which is otherwise compliant with RFC 4347. The evaluator shall observe that the TSF silently drops the server hello 
                    message or terminates the session as described in the ST.
                    <h:p>
                      <h:b>Note:</h:b> The TSF is required not to accept a negotiation of DTLS 1.0. This test confirms the TSF is able to
                      distinguish attempts to negotiate DTLS 1.0 when the TLS 1.1 and below downgrade indicator is provided, and is only 
                      performed when the indicator is processed resulting in a different behavior than other attempts to negotiate DTLS 1.0.
                      If the TSF terminates the session according to the unique behavior indicated in the ST, the test is successful. If the
                      TSF silently drops the message, the evaluator shall continue sending the server finished until the TSF demonstrates the 
                      unique response to the downgrade indicator as described in the ST. It is preferred that the TSF logs a fatal error 
                      alert message (illegal parameter or unsupported version), but it is acceptable that the TSF terminate the session
                      without logging an error alert. 
                    </h:p><h:p>
                      Use of the TLS 1.1 and below indicator as a redundant mechanism 
                      where there is no configuration that actually processes the value does not require additional testing, 
                      since this would be addressed by <xref to="dtls-client-obsolete-versions"/> for FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.1. 
                      This test is only required if the TSF responds differently (e.g., a different error alert) when the downgrade indicator is present than when DTLS 1.0 or below is negotiated and the downgrade indicator is not present.

              <h:p>
                A client supporting DTLS 1.3 must claim “rejection of all renegotiation attempts.” This option may also be claimed as a
                method for TLS 1.2 renegotiation protection.
              </h:p>
              <h:p>
                The TLS_EMPTY_RENEGOTIATION_INFO_SCSV is the preferred mechanism for DTLS 1.2 protection against insecure renegotiation when
                the client does not renegotiate. The ST author will claim "a hello request message is received" in the second selection to
                indicate support for this mechanism.
              </h:p>
              <h:p>
                RFC 5746 allows the client to accept connections with servers that do not support the extension; this FP refines RFC 5746
                and requires the client to terminate sessions with such servers. Thus, unexpected server hello messages include
                <h:ul>
                  <h:li>
                    an initial server hello negotiating DTLS 1.2 that does not contain a renegotiation_info extension

                  <h:li>
                    a subsequent server hello renegotiating DTLS 1.2 that does not contain a renegotiation_info extension

                  <h:li>
                    a subsequent server hello negotiating DTLS 1.2 that has a renegotiation_info extension with an incorrect renegotiated_connection value

                 and
                  <h:li>
                    a server hello request message when renegotiation is not allowed (for DTLS 1.3 or when the option is claimed for TLS 1.2).

                DTLS 1.3 provides protection against insecure renegotiation by not allowing renegotiation. If DTLS 1.3 is claimed in
                FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.1, the client receives a server hello that attempts to negotiate DTLS 1.3, and the server hello also contains
                a non-empty renegotiation_info extension; the client will terminate the connection or silently discard the message.

            DTLS supports TLS ciphersuites. The ST author selects the ciphersuites that are supported and must select at least one ciphersuite
            suitable for each supported DTLS version – TLS 1.2 ciphersuites for DTLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 ciphersuites for DTLS 1.3. It is necessary
            to limit the ciphersuites that can be used administratively in an evaluated configuration on the server in the test environment. If
            administrative steps need to be taken so that the ciphersuites negotiated by the implementation are limited to those in this
            requirement, then the appropriate instructions need to be contained in the guidance.

            The final selection indicates the TOE’s preference for negotiating a ciphersuite. RFC 9151 indicates the required ciphersuites for

            priority is used, the ST author will claim the third option and describe the scheme in the ST.

        DTLS uses TLS extensions. If support for DTLS 1.3 is claimed in FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1.1, the selections for supported_versions, supported_groups, and key_share are claimed. If DTLS 1.3 is not claimed, supported_versions and key_share are not claimed.

          If DTLS 1.2 is supported and DHE or ECDHE ciphersuites are claimed in FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1.2, the entry for supported_groups is claimed. Support for additional extensions is acceptable. For signature_algorithms and signature_algorithms_certs (if supported), at least one of the signature schemes presented in the first sub-selection is claimed.

          If DTLS 1.2 and RSA ciphersuites are supported, the ST author claims the “RSA with key size …” option and the key

          by the server.
        </h:p>
        <h:p>
          If DTLS 1.2 and supported groups extension are supported (for ECDHE or DHE groups), the ST author claims either the
          “Diffie_Hellman groups…” or “ECDHE parameters...” option according to the supported ciphersuites and supported groups extension
          values. This is required when ECDHE ciphersuites are supported and recommended when DHE ciphersuites are supported.

        The TSF shall not proceed with a connection handshake attempt if the DTLS client fails validation.
      </title>
      <note role="application">
        The process to validate the IP address of a DTLS client is specified in RFC 6347, Section 4.2.1 (DTLS 1.2) and in RFC 9147, Section 5.1 (DTLS 1.3). 
        The server validates the DTLS client during connection establishment (handshaking) and prior to sending a server hello message. 
        After receiving a client hello, a DTLS 1.2 server sends a HelloVerifyRequest along with a cookie, 
        whereas a DTLS 1.3 server sends a HelloRetryRequest message along with a cookie. 
        In both TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3, the cookie is a signed message using a keyed hash function. 
        The DTLS client then sends another client hello with the cookie attached. 
        If the DTLS server successfully verifies the signed cookie, the client is not using a spoofed IP address.

            It is sufficient to observe the successful negotiation of a ciphersuite to satisfy the intent of the test; it is not necessary to examine the characteristics of the encrypted traffic in an attempt to discern the ciphersuite being used (for example, that the cryptographic algorithm is 128-bit AES and not 256-bit AES).

            It is not necessary to pair every supported ciphersuite with every supported group. It is sufficient to use a set of ciphersuite and supported group pairs such that each ciphersuite and each supported group are included in this set.

                            The evaluator shall send a client hello to the TOE as in the previous test with identical ciphersuite and supported
                            group extension values. After the TSF sends the valid key exchange message, the evaluator shall send a client key

                            the key exchange message or terminates the handshake.

                            The evaluator shall send a third client hello to the TOE as in the previous two tests indicating the same supported ECDHE ciphersuite, but now instead including an ECDHE group that is not supported. The evaluator shall observe that the TSF silently drops the client hello message or terminates the session.

If the TSF supports all registered ECDHE groups, it is acceptable to send the client hello without a supported groups extension. The TSF should reject such a client hello, but it is acceptable for the TSF to default to a supported group. In this case, the TSF passes the test.

                  in the client’s certificate chain. If claimed, the ST author will describe in the assignment for intermediate values which
                  CA certificates are included in the exception (for example, “all intermediates but the issuing CA” or “specific end-entity

          Authorization for services provided by the applications that are protected by the DTLS session is determined by the supported
          function establishing a set of reference identifiers, by passing the received identifiers to the supported function, or by passing
          initial name constraints to the certification path validation function. The ST author indicates the methods supported, and for each
          method supported, indicates all name types supported; if name types are processed by the TSF, at least one name type is required.
          In the assignment of the first option, the ST author indicates all name types and the corresponding method for matching in the
          sub-selections. In the second method option, the ST author indicates which name type normalizations the product supports. If the
          product passes the entire validated certificate to the application, no normalization of the names contained in the certificate is
          expected. If the third method is claimed, the ST author indicates which name types are supported for formulating initial name
          constraints.

          </h:p>
        </Guidance>
        <Tests>
          The evaluator shall use DTLS as a function to verify that the validation rules in <no-link>FIA_X509_EXT.1</no-link> are adhered to and shall perform the tests listed below in conjunction with testing for <no-link>FIA_X509_EXT.1</no-link>. 
          The evaluator shall apply the operational guidance to configure the server to require DTLS mutual authentication of clients for these tests unless overridden by instructions in the test activity.
          <h:p>
            <h:b>Note:</h:b> DTLS 1.3 is a fundamentally different protocol than DTLS 1.2, so even though the certificate validation and name checking tests are identical for both versions, it is likely that early deployments of DTLS 1.3 may use a different code-base that warrants independent testing. If both DTLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.3 are supported and the evaluator can verify that the TSF uses the same code-base for certificate validation and name checking for both DTLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.2, it is acceptable that testing be performed for only one version for these tests.

              For each supported version, the evaluator shall follow the operational guidance to configure the TOE to require valid client authentication with no exceptions in support of a function (configured, as necessary) that does not allow unauthenticated sessions, and initiate a DTLS session from a compliant DTLS test client 
              supporting that version. The evaluator shall ensure that the test client sends a certificate_list structure which has a length of zero. The evaluator shall verify the TSF silently drops the message or terminates the session, and that no application data flows. 
              <h:p>
                <h:b>Note:</h:b> If the TSF terminates the connection, the test is successful. If the TSF silently drops the message, the evaluator shall continue sending the client certificate message until the TSF times out. It is preferred that the TSF logs a fatal error alert message (e.g., handshake failure, bad certificate, unknown certificate, unknown CA) in response to this, but it is acceptable that the TSF terminates the connection silently (i.e., without logging a fatal error alert).

            <test>[conditional] If the ST indicates that the TSF supports establishment of a DTLS session for missing or invalid certificates, then for each supported version, 
              and for each supported response option for a missing or invalid certificate indicated in FCS_DTLSS_EXT.2.3, the evaluator shall configure the TSF according to the operational guidance 
              to respond as indicated for the calling application. The evaluator shall send client handshake messages from a test DTLS client as indicated for each sub-test. The evaluator shall perform the following sub-tests:
              <testlist>
                <test>[conditional]: If the TSF supports non-authenticated session establishment when receiving an empty certificate message, 
                  the evaluator shall initiate a DTLS handshake from a compliant test DTLS client supporting the version and providing a certificate message 
                  containing a certificate_list structure of length zero. The evaluator shall confirm that the TSF notifies the calling application that the user is unauthenticated.
                  <h:p>
                    <h:b>Note:</h:b> Specific procedures for determining that the calling application is notified will vary based on the application. 
                    If an API to the calling application is not available, the evaluator may attempt to configure the calling application to provide a different response 
                    (e.g., require authentication for flagged data) for authenticated and non-authenticated users and make a request at the test client that results in a response 
                    indicating the application is treating the client as non-authenticated.
                  </h:p></test>

                  The evaluator shall establish a primary certificate chain for the test client that only exhibits the allowed exception 
                  and one or more alternate certificate chains for the test client that do not pass the exception rule, as necessary to test the boundaries of the exception rules.

                    The evaluator shall follow the operational guidance to remove any cached revocation status information for the test client’s primary certificate chain. 
                    The evaluator shall initiate a valid TLS session from the test client that presents the primary certificate for the test client, 
                    provide any feedback requested by the TSF to confirm the exception, and observe that the TSF allows the certificate and completes the DTLS handshake successfully. 
                  </h:p><h:p>
                    For each alternate certificate chain, the evaluator shall repeat the session initiation from the test client but present the alternate certificate chain and observe that the TSF silently drops the message or terminates the session.

                    <h:b>Note:</h:b> If the TSF terminates the connection, the test is successful. If the TSF silently drops the message, the evaluator shall continue sending the client certificate and certificate verify messages until the TSF times out.

                    The alternate certificate chains are intended to test the boundaries of the exception rules. 
                    For example, if the exception rule indicates that only leaf certificates are exempt, the evaluator shall include an alternate certificate chain for which a CA certificate’s revocation information is advertised but is not available; 
                    if the exception can be configured for an explicit leaf certificate, or particular subjects, an alternate chain will be included that does not include an excepted certificate or subject. 
                    If the exception rules can be configured for all certificates having advertised revocation information, an alternate certificate chain can include an expired certificate – only one additional validity failure 
                    (e.g., expired certificate) is required in this case. More comprehensive validity failure handling is addressed by testing for <no-link>FIA_X509_EXT.1</no-link>.

                Names of special types implicitly encoded in the CN entry of the certificate subject name are especially prone to error since they may only be validated 
                by the issuing CA as a directory name (RDN) type, especially if the issuing CA is unaware of the intended encoding as a different name type. 
                It is a best practice that when the CN is interpreted as an embedded name type other than RDN, an explicitly encoded SAN entry should take precedence.

                If the TSF supports DTLS 1.2, the ST author claims either method of protecting against insecure renegotiation attempts. The
                first selection refines RFC 5746, which defines an extension to (D)TLS 1.2 that binds renegotiation handshakes to the
                cryptography in the original handshake, but allows interoperability with clients that do not follow RFC 5746. As a
                refinement of the RFC, servers that support DTLS 1.2 renegotiation will terminate a session if neither of the methods
                described in RFC 5746 are offered by the client. Alternatively, a DTLS  server supporting DTLS 1.2 may negotiate DTLS 1.2
                without any RFC 5746 client renegotiation indicators, if it always terminates an existing session when a new client hello is
                received or silently ignores unexpected client hello messages, similar to the implementation of DTLS 1.3.

                The ST author indicates which session resumption mechanisms are supported. If DTLS 1.2 is supported, one or both of the first
                two options, "session ID in accordance with RFC 5246" and "tickets in accordance with RFC 5077" are claimed. If DTLS 1.3 is

                While it is possible to perform session resumption using PSK ciphersuites in DTLS 1.2, this is uncommon. Validation of key

                    The evaluator shall allow the TOE and test client to continue with the compliant handshake until resumption information is established but then cause a fatal error to terminate the session. 
                    The evaluator shall then send a new client hello in an attempt to resume the session with the resumption information provided 
                    and verify that the TSF does not resume the session, but instead silently drops the message, terminates the session, or completes a full handshake, ignoring the resumption information.
                    <h:p>
                      <h:b>Note:</h:b> For DTLS 1.2, resumption information should be established at the point the TSF sends a server hello, either acknowledging the session-based resumption 
                      or acknowledging support for ticket-based resumption and sending a new_ticket message. 
                      A DTLS 1.2 session can then be terminated by sending a modified finished message. 
                      For DTLS 1.3, the new_ticket message is sent after the finished message; once received by the client, the session can be terminated by modifying a byte of the encrypted application data.

                    <h:p>
                      To terminate the DTLS session, it might be necessary to continue sending the invalid finished or application message until the TSF times out. If the TSF terminates the session or responds with a full handshake ignoring the resumption information, the test is successful. If the TSF silently drops the client hello containing the resumption information of the failed session, the evaluator shall continue sending the message until the TSF times out.

              The ST author should select the ciphersuites that are supported, and must select at least one ciphersuite for each TLS version
              supported. Pre-shared secret ciphersuites for TLS 1.2 are only claimed as required by a specific PP. The ciphersuites to be
              tested in the evaluated configuration are limited by this requirement. However, this requirement does not restrict the TOE's
              ability to propose additional non-deprecated ciphersuites beyond the ones listed in this requirement in its client hello
              message as indicated in the ST. That is, the TOE may propose any ciphersuite not excluded by this element, but the evaluation
              will only test ciphersuites from the above list. It is necessary to limit the ciphersuites that can be used administratively in
              an evaluated configuration on the server in the test environment.

              TLS 1.3 ciphersuites are claimed if support for TLS 1.3 is claimed in FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.1. 
              The assignment of preference order provides an ordered list of all supported ciphersuites with the most preferred ciphersuites
              listed first.

              <h:p>
              While mandatory for RFC 8446, TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 is deprecated by this SFR and should not be included in “other TLS 1.3
              ciphersuites.” The ST author may list additional TLS 1.3 ciphersuites as they are registered.
              </h:p>
              <h:p>
              In addition to the supported ciphersuites, the ST author indicates the order of ciphersuites included in the client hello,
              indicating the preferred ciphersuites for server negotiation. It is recommended, but not required, that the TLS 1.3 ciphersuites
              claimed are listed before TLS 1.2 ciphersuites, and that any other ciphersuites are listed last among the TLS 1.3 ciphersuites.

                This element explicitly excludes ciphersuites defined for TLS 1.2 and previous TLS or SSL versions that might be included in the 
                client hello from a TSF that supports TLS 1.2 (as the only supported version, or as a fallback version for TLS 1.3 clients 
                negotiating with potential DTLS 1.2 servers). The requirement also constrains the choice of "other TLS 1.3 ciphersuites" when
                TLS 1.3 is supported. In addition, this requirement prohibits Using Raw Public Keys in Transport Layer Security and Datagram

                The ST author claims the supported options for verifying that the server is associated with an expected reference identifier. The first option is claimed if the TSF implements name matching. The option “interface with a supported function…” is claimed if the validated certification path, names extracted from the subject field and/or subject alternate name extension of a leaf certificate of a validated certification path, or normalized representations of names extracted from the leaf certificate are passed to a supported function for matching. The option “pass initial name constraints…” is claimed if the TSF formulates initial name constraints from the reference identifiers used by the certification path processing function. The final option is claimed if TLS 1.2 is supported and PSK ciphersuites are supported, and is used to associate the shared PSK with a known identifier.
              </h:p>
              <h:p>
                If the TSF matches names, the rules for verification of identity are described in RFC 6125, Section 6 and RFC 5280, Section 7. If "Common name conversion..."
              is claimed, both the subject field and the converted common name are matched.
              The reference identifier is established by the user (e.g., entering a URL into a web browser or clicking a link), 
              by configuration (e.g., configuring the name of a mail or authentication server), 
              or by an application (e.g., a parameter of an API) depending on the supported function. 
              The client establishes all acceptable reference identifiers for matching against the presented identifiers as validated in the
              server’s certificate. 
              If the TSF performs matching of the reference identifiers to the identifiers provided in the server’s certificate, 
              the first option is claimed and all supported name types are claimed. If the TSF presents the certificate 
              or the presented identifiers from the certificate to the supported function, the second option is claimed.
              If the TSF constructs initial name constraints derived from the reference identifiers for validation during certification path
              validation, the third option is claimed.
              </h:p>
              <h:p>
              In most cases where TLS servers are represented by DNS-type names, 
              the preferred method for verification is the Subject Alternative Name using DNS, URI, or Service Names. 
              Verification using a conversion of the Common Name relative distinguished name from a DNS name type in the subject field is allowed for the purposes of backward compatibility. 
              </h:p>
              <h:p>
              The client should avoid constructing reference identifiers using wildcards. However, if the presented identifiers include wildcards, 
              the client must follow the best practices regarding matching; these best practices are captured in the evaluation activity. 
              If the TSF supports wildcards, and allows names with DNS portions containing internationalized names, 
              the internationalized name should not match any wildcard, in accordance with RFC 6125 section 7.2.
              </h:p><h:p>  
              Support for other name types is rare, but may be claimed for specific applications. 
              If specified, the assignment includes both the RFC describing normalization and matching rules, 
              and any refinements necessary to resolve options available in the RFC.

              Note that FIA_X509_EXT.1 may allow methods other than CRL or OCSP to validate the revocation status of a certificate. A
              certificate that exclusively uses these alternate methods may not advertise revocation status information locations. 
              Thus, a certificate that is valid according to FIA_X509_EXT.1 and does not advertise revocation status information in a CRL_DP
              or AIA extension is considered to be not revoked. TLS-specific override mechanisms are for use with certificates with published
              revocation status information that is not accessible, whether temporarily or because the information cannot be accessed during
              the state of the TOE (e.g., for verifying signatures on boot code). The circumstances should be described by the ST author, who
              should indicate the override mechanism and conditions that apply to the override, including system state, user or admin actions, etc.

                The evaluator shall check the description of the implementation of this protocol in the TSS to ensure the supported TLS versions, features, ciphersuites, and extensions 
                are specified in accordance with RFC 5246 (TLS 1.2) and RFC 8446 (TLS 1.3 and updates to TLS 1.2) and as refined in FCS_TLSC_EXT.1 as appropriate.

                The evaluator shall verify that ciphersuites indicated in FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.2 are included in the description, and that none of the following ciphersuites are supported: ciphersuites indicating 
                NULL, RC2, RC4, DES, IDEA, TDES, or AES-128 in the encryption algorithm component, indicating 'anon,' or indicating MD5 or SHA in the message digest algorithm component.
                </h:p>
                <h:p>
                The evaluator shall verify that the TLS implementation description includes the extensions as required in FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.4.
                </h:p>
                <h:p>
                The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes applications that use the TLS functions and how they establish reference identifiers.
                </h:p>
                <h:p>
                If name matching is supported, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS includes a description of matching methods used for each supported name type to 
                the supported application defined reference identifiers. 
                The evaluator shall verify that the TSS includes a description 
                of wildcards recognized for each name type claimed in FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.5 and shall verify that the matching rules meet or exceed best practices. 
                In particular, the evaluator shall ensure that the matching rules are as restrictive as, or more restrictive than the following: 
                <h:ul>
                <h:li>DNS names: The ‘*’ character used in the complete leftmost label of a DNS name represents any valid name that has the same number of labels, 
                  and that matches all remaining labels. The ‘*’ character must only be used in the leftmost complete label of a properly formatted DNS name. 
                  The ‘*’ must not be used to represent a public suffix, or in the leftmost label immediately following a public suffix. </h:li>
                <h:li>URI or SRV names: The ‘*’ character can only occur in the domain name portion of the name represented as a DNS name. 
                  All restrictions for wildcards in DNS names apply to the DNS portion of the name.
                URI host names presented as an IP address are matched according to IP address matching rules – see best practices for IP addresses below. 
                In accordance with RFC 6125, it is preferred that such URIs are presented a matching name of type IP address in the SAN. </h:li>
                <h:li>IP addresses: RFC 5280 does not support IP address ranges as presented names, 
                  but indicates that presented names may be compared to IP address ranges present in name constraints. 
                  If the TSF supports IP address ranges as reference identifiers, the reference identifier matches if the presented name is in the range. 
                  IP ranges in name constraints (including reference identifiers) should be presented in CIDR format. </h:li>
                <h:li>RFC 2822 names: RFC 5280 and updates RFC 8398 and RFC 8399 do not support special indicators representing 
                  more than a single mailbox as a presented name, but indicates that presented names may be compared to a single mailbox, 
                  ‘any’ email address at a host, or ‘any’ email address on a domain 
                  (e.g., “example.com” matches any email address on the host example.com and “.example.com” matches any email address in the domain example.com, 
                  but does not match email addresses at the host “example.com”). Such matching is prohibited for internationalized RFC 2822 names.</h:li>
                  <h:li>Embedded CN name types: The CN relative distinguished name of a DNS name type included in the subject field is not strongly typed. Attempts to match both the name type and wildcard specifications can result in matches not intended, and therefore, not authoritatively asserted by a certification authority. It is preferred that no matching of CN embedded names be supported, but if necessary for backward compatibility, the description should clearly indicate how different name types are interpreted in the matching algorithm. If an embedded CN is present, the DN structure containing the CN as an RDN is matched, and the CN component is further matched according to the specific rules for the implied name type. In particular, the ‘*’ character in a CN is not to be interpreted as representing more than a single entity unless the entirety of the RDN is properly formatted as a DNS, URI, or SVR name, and represents a wildcard meeting best practices as described above.</h:li>
                </h:ul>
                </h:p>
                <h:p>
                  If name types are passed to the supported functions, the evaluator shall verify that for each claimed supported function, the TSS includes a description of the information used to validate the identifier that is passed to that function.
                </h:p>
                <h:p>
                  If name constraints are passed to the certificate verification function, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes
                  the initial allow and deny tables for each reference identity reference name supported.

                The evaluator shall check the operational guidance to ensure that it contains instructions on configuring the product so that TLS conforms to the description in the TSS and that 
                it includes any instructions on configuring the version, ciphersuites, or optional extensions that are supported.
                </h:p><h:p>
                The evaluator shall verify that all configurable features for matching identifiers in certificates presented in the TLS handshake to application specific reference identifiers are described.

                  The evaluator shall observe that the TSF presents a client hello indicating TLS 1.2 (value '03 03') in the highest or legacy version field and, if TLS 1.3 is supported, the supported versions extension is present and contains the value '03 04' for TLS 1.3.
                  </h:p><h:p>
                  The evaluator shall observe that the client hello indicates the supported ciphersuites in the order indicated, 
                  and that it includes only the extensions supported, with appropriate values, for that version in accordance with the requirement.

                    <h:b>Note:</h:b> The highest version field is renamed to the legacy version field for TLS 1.3. Regardless of the versions supported, this field is required to indicate TLS 1.2. If the TOE supports both TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3, the client hello should indicate all ciphersuites and all extensions as required for either version. In particular, the supported versions extension is required and must include the TLS 1.3 value ('03 04') and may also include the TLS 1.2 indicator ('03 03').

                  It is sufficient to observe the successful negotiation of a ciphersuite to satisfy the intent of the test; 
                  it is not necessary to examine the characteristics of the encrypted traffic in an attempt to discern the ciphersuite being used 
                  (for example, that the cryptographic algorithm is 128-bit AES and not 256-bit AES).

           The evaluator shall observe negotiation of a TLS channel and confirm that the TOE did not send a Client’s Certificate message (type 11) during handshake.</test>
         <test>The evaluator shall establish a connection to a test TLS server with a shared trusted root that is configured for mutual authentication 
           (i.e., it sends a Server’s Certificate Request (type 13) message). 
           The evaluator shall observe negotiation of a TLS channel and confirm that the TOE responds with a non-empty Client’s Certificate message (type 11) and Certificate Verify (type 15) message.</test>
         <test>[conditional] If the TSF supports post-handshake authentication, 
           the evaluator shall establish a pre-shared key between the TSF and a test TLS 1.3 server. 
           The evaluator shall initiate a TLS session using the pre-shared key and confirm the TSF and test TLS 1.3 server successfully complete the TLS handshake and both support post-handshake authentication.

              The ST author claims the “TLS 1.2 downgrade indicator” when FCS_TLSC_EXT.1 indicates support for both TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 and 
              implements supplemental downgrade protection. 
              This option is not claimed if TLS 1.3 is not supported. 
              The “TLS 1.1 or below downgrade indicator” option may also be claimed if supported, 
              but should only be claimed if the TSF is capable of detecting the indicator. 
              This package requires the TSF to always terminate TLS 1.1 sessions based on the server hello negotiated version field; it is 
              acceptable to ignore any downgrade indicator. 
              However, a TSF that is capable of detecting the TLS 1.1 or below downgrade indicator may claim this option if it takes
              different actions depending on whether the TLS 1.1 or below downgrade indicator is set.

                <test>[conditional] If the TSF supports the TLS 1.1 or below downgrade indicator and if the ST indicates a configuration where the indicator is processed, 
                  the evaluator shall follow operational guidance instructions to configure the TSF so it parses a TLS 1.1 handshake to detect and process the TLS downgrade indicator. 
                  The evaluator shall initiate a TLS session between the TOE and a test TLS server that is configured to send a TLS 1.1 server hello message 
                  with the downgrade indicator ‘44 4F 57 4E 47 52 44 00’ in the last eight bytes of the server random field,

              A client supporting TLS 1.2 renegotiation may present either the "renegotiation_info" extension or the 
              signaling ciphersuite value TLS_EMPTY_RENEGOTIATION_INFO_SCSV in the initial 
              client hello message to indicate support for secure renegotiation.
              </h:p>
              <h:p>
                A client supporting TLS 1.3 must claim "rejection of all renegotiation attempts." This option may also be claimed as a 
                method for TLS 1.2 renegotiation protection.
              </h:p>
              <h:p>
              The TLS_EMPTY_RENEGOTIATION_INFO_SCSV is the preferred mechanism for TLS 1.2 protection against insecure renegotiation when the
              client does not renegotiate. 
              The ST author will claim the ‘hello request message is received’ option in the second selection to indicate support for this
              mechanism.
              </h:p>
              <h:p>
              RFC 5746 allows the client to accept connections with servers that do not support the extension; 
              this FP refines RFC 5746 and requires the client to terminate sessions with such servers. 
              Thus, unexpected server hello messages include an initial server hello negotiating 
              TLS 1.2 that does not contain a renegotiation_info extension, 
              an initial server hello negotiating TLS 1.2 that has a renegotiation_info extension that is non-empty, 
              a subsequent server hello renegotiating TLS 1.2 that does not contain a renegotiation_info extension, 
              a subsequent server hello negotiating TLS 1.2 that has a renegotiation_info extension with an incorrect renegotiated_connection
              value, and a server hello request message when renegotiation is not allowed (for TLS 1.3 or when the option is claimed for TLS 1.2). 
              </h:p>
              <h:p>
              TLS 1.3 provides protection against insecure renegotiation by not allowing renegotiation. 
              If TLS 1.3 is claimed in FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.1, the client receives a server hello that attempts to negotiate TLS 1.3, and the server hello
              also contains a non-empty renegotiation_info extension; the client will terminate the connection.

              if resumption of TLS 1.2 sessions is supported. 
              If resumption of TLS 1.3 sessions is supported, "PSK and tickets in accordance with RFC 8446" is selected, and the selection-based SFR FCS_TLSC_EXT.6 must also be claimed.
              </h:p><h:p>
              While it is possible to perform session resumption using PSK ciphersuites in TLS 1.2, this is uncommon. 
              Validation of key exchange and session negotiation rules for PSK ciphersuites is independent of the source of the pre-shared key and is covered in FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.

             If the third method is claimed, the ST author indicates which name types are supported for formulating initial name constraints.
             </h:p>
             <h:p>
             If name normalization is claimed, care should be taken regarding wildcards and IP addresses. 
             IP addresses embedded in DNS host names and in Directory Name CN components have been observed to include non-standard wildcard designations including the ‘*’ character. 
             Any embedded IP addresses should use standard CIDR notation and should not include nonstandard encoding.

	        <h:p>
	          <h:b>Note:</h:b> TLS 1.3 is a fundamentally different protocol than TLS 1.2, so even though the certificate validation and name checking tests are identical for both versions, it is likely that early deployments of TLS 1.3 may use a different code-base that warrants independent testing. If both TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are supported and the evaluator can verify that the TSF uses the same code-base for certificate validation and name checking for both TLS 1.3 and TLS 1.2, it is acceptable that testing be performed for only one version for these tests.

	            <testlist>
	              <test>[conditional]: If the TSF supports non-authenticated session establishment when receiving an empty certificate message, 
	                the evaluator shall initiate a TLS handshake from a compliant test TLS client supporting the version and providing a certificate message

	                (e.g., require authentication for flagged data) for authenticated and non-authenticated users and make a request at the test client that results in a response 
	                indicating the application is treating the client as non-authenticated.
	                </h:p></test>
	              <test>[conditional] If the TSF supports exceptions for when revocation status information is unavailable, 
	                then the evaluator shall follow the operational guidance to attempt to establish a narrowly defined exception for which both exempt and non-exempt certificates can be established. 
	                The evaluator shall establish a primary certificate chain for the test client that only exhibits the allowed exception 
	                and one or more alternate certificate chains for the test client that do not pass the exception rule, as necessary to test the boundaries of the exception rules. 
	                <h:p>
	                The evaluator shall follow the operational guidance to remove any cached revocation status information for the test client’s primary certificate chain. 
	                The evaluator shall initiate a valid TLS session from the test client that presents the primary certificate for the test client, 
	                provide any feedback requested by the TSF to confirm the exception, and observe that the TSF allows the certificate and completes the TLS handshake successfully. 
	                </h:p><h:p>
	                For each alternate certificate chain, the evaluator shall repeat the session initiation from the test client but present the alternate certificate chain and observe that the TSF terminates the session.

	                <h:b>Note:</h:b> It is preferred that the TSF sends a fatal error alert message (e.g., bad certificate, unknown certificate, access denied, handshake error) in response to this,

	                </h:p><h:p>
	                The alternate certificate chains are intended to test the boundaries of the exception rules. 
	                For example, if the exception rule indicates that only leaf certificates are exempt, the evaluator shall include an alternate certificate chain for which a CA certificate’s revocation information is advertised but is not available; 
	                if the exception can be configured for an explicit leaf certificate, or particular subjects, an alternate chain will be included that does not include an excepted certificate or subject. 
	                If the exception rules can be configured for all certificates having advertised revocation information, an alternate certificate chain can include an expired certificate – only one additional validity failure 
	                (e.g., expired certificate) is required in this case. More comprehensive validity failure handling is addressed by testing for <no-link>FIA_X509_EXT.1</no-link>.

              If the TSF supports TLS 1.2, the ST author claims either method of protecting against insecure renegotiation attempts. The first
              selection refines RFC 5746. RFC 5746 defines an extension to TLS 1.2 that binds renegotiation handshakes to the cryptography in
              the original handshake, but allows interoperability with clients that do not follow RFC 5746. 
              As a refinement of the RFC, servers that support TLS 1.2 renegotiation will terminate a session if neither of the methods
              described in RFC 5746 are offered by the client.               
              Alternatively, a TLS server supporting TLS 1.2 may negotiate TLS 1.2 without any RFC 5746 client renegotiation indicators 
              if it always terminates an existing session when a new client hello is received, similar to the implementation of TLS 1.3.

              If the TSF supports TLS 1.3, the ST author must claim "does not allow renegotiation."
              TLS 1.3 does not allow renegotiation. Termination, as indicated in FCS_TLSS_EXT.4.3, covers TLS 1.3 sessions as well as TLS 1.2
              sessions where the client hello received does not comply with RFC 5746, or when configured to reject renegotiation (if the
