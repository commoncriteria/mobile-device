# TDs README

This is the TD directory. 
For a release branch, authors should create XML representations for all TDs issued for this version of the PP document.
Eventually these TD files should be pulled into the development branch, usually the 'master' branch.
Once they get pulled into the master branch, they should be manually incoporated into the main XML input document and then deleted from the master branch.
