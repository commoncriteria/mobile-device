<!-- TODO: 
 - <xref to="mf-alwaysOnVPN"/> for the FMT_SMF functions display table prior to function number

- I need to rename iteration for - FDP_UPC_EXT.1/NORMAL
- Open Issues on github
- HW Equivalency - see Dianne's email
- Fix biometric equations per example in PP template
       
-->

<!-- TODO v 3.3
- Update WLAN EP references to WLAN Module
- Remove SHA1 and any app notes about WLAN needing SHA 1
- <selectable exclusive="yes"> - for "no other" in any selection
-->


<!-- DONE:
  BT Module - need to update with the TRRT/TD
  - TRRTs with PP change needed
    - BT - keep SFRs mapped to MDF objectives, but need to update SFR numbers - DONE
    - Moved BT to implementation dependent - IF BT HW exists then mandatory, if BT HW does not exist then not mandatory 
          - Iterated FDP_UPC, removed BT from the mandatory iteration and iteration (just BT) in optional A.3 - implementation dependent. 
    - All TDs as of 2019_09_01
    - mutual auth required for TLS and DTLS
    -	EAs that include API documentation according to adv OR in entropy documentation – Just put at top of EA outside of TSS flag
    - Move FAU_GEN table 1 and 2 move out of the EA and into the application note 
    - Updated FMT_SMF function numbers to be ctr variables
    - selection for FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.3 and FCS_DTLS_EXT.1.3 (in package) to not allow exceptions for when server cert is invalid.  
   - MDF fcs_tlsc/dtls_ext.1.3 is similar to fcs_tlsc/dtls_ext.1.3 in package, but package has [selection: with no exceptions, except when override is authorized]. How do I specify which selection has to be made?? MDF: The <abbr linkend="TSF"/> shall not establish a trusted channel if the peer certificate is invalid. However, HTTPS requires different behavior, though HTTPS is implemented over TLS. This element addresses non-HTTPS TLS connections.
    - DONE: Added FMT_SMF Function 21 and added app note to HTTPS.1.3
-->

<!-- TODO_Future:
 - cert stapling:
      - OSCP stapling for establishing the WLAN connection
      - Can this fix the what to do when a connection is not available to verify the validity?
 - EA for radio testing
     -	FMT_SMF_EXT.1 Function 4 AA – need to fix it with respect to setting up the testing environment setup (RF noise floor, sweeping frequency…) and to address power up spikes (power to the radio before realizing that the device is in Airplane mode for both cellular and wifi)
     - Technical Query 839: FCS_STG_EXT.2.2 (and interaction with 3.1)

- <selectable id= " "/> and selection depends ids for the selectable SFRs

      mobile device contains Bluetooth functionality (i.e., has Bluetooth hardware), the Bluetooth
      connectivity shall be evaluated against the PP-Module for Bluetooth.
	  As illustrated in <xref to="TOE"/>, it is expected that a typical deployment would also include either
      third-party or bundled components. Whether these components are bundled as part of the Mobile

      against the related assurance standards such as the PP-Module for MDM Agent, PP-Module for VPN
      Client, PP-Module for VVoIP, and cPP-Module for Biometrics. It is the responsibility of the architect of
      the overall secure mobile architecture to ensure validation of these components. Additional
      applications that may come pre-installed on the Mobile Device that are not validated are
      considered to be potentially flawed, but not malicious. Examples include email client and web

        In addition to providing essential security services, the Mobile Device
        includes the necessary security functionality to support configurations for these various use
        cases.
        Each use case may require additional configuration and applications to achieve the
        desired security.
        A selection of these use cases is elaborated below.
      </htm:p><htm:p>
        Several of the use case templates include objective requirements that are strongly desired for
        the indicated use cases.
        Readers can expect those requirements to be made mandatory in a
        future revision of this protection profile, and industry should aim to include that security
        functionality in products in the near-term.
      </htm:p><htm:p>

          This use case entails a significant degree of enterprise control over configuration

          The enterprise elects to provide users with Mobile Devices and additional applications (such as
          VPN or email clients) in order to maintain control of their Enterprise data and security of
          their networks.
          Users may use Internet connectivity to browse the web or access corporate mail
          or run enterprise applications, but this connectivity may be under significant control of the
          enterprise.

    <usecase title="Enterprise-owned device for specialized, high security use" id="uc-secure">
       <description>
       <htm:br/>
     An enterprise-owned device with intentionally limited network connectivity, tightly controlled configuration, and limited software inventory is appropriate for specialized, high-security use cases. For example, the device may not be permitted connectivity to any external peripherals. It may only be able to communicate via its Wi-Fi or cellular radios with the enterprise-run network, which may not even permit connectivity to the Internet. Use of the device may entail compliance with policies that are more restrictive than those in any general-purpose use case, yet may mitigate risks to highly sensitive information. As in the previous case, the enterprise will look for additional applications providing enterprise connectivity and services to have a similar level of assurance as the platform.

        A personally-owned device, which is used, for both personal activities and enterprise data is commonly called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). The device may be provisioned for access to enterprise resources after significant personal usage has occurred. Unlike in the enterprise-owned cases, the enterprise is limited in what security policies it can enforce because the user purchased the device primarily for personal use and is unlikely to accept policies that limit the functionality of the device. However, because the enterprise allows the user full (or nearly full) access to the enterprise network, the enterprise will require their own security controls to ensure that enterprise resources are protected from potential threats posed by the personal activities on the device. These controls could potentially be enforced by a separation mechanism built-in to the device itself to distinguish between enterprise and personal activities, or by a third-party application that provides access to enterprise resources and leverages security capabilities provided by the mobile device. Based upon the operational environment and the acceptable risk level of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in <xref to="Security_Requirements"/> of this PP along with the selections in the Use Case 3 template defined in Appendix F - Use Case Templates are sufficient for the secure implementation of this BYOD use case.

          A personally-owned device, which is used, for both personal activities and enterprise data is commonly called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). This device may be provisioned for limited access to enterprise resources such as enterprise email. Because the user does not have full access to the enterprise or enterprise data, the enterprise may not need to enforce any security policies on the device. However, the enterprise may want secure email and web browsing with assurance that the services being provided to those clients by the Mobile Device are not compromised. Based upon the operational environment and the acceptable risk level of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in Section 5 Security Requirements of this PP are sufficient for the secure implementation of this BYOD use case.

      cases. <xref to="use"/> provides use case templates that list those selections,
      assignments, and objective requirements that best support the use cases identified by this
      Protection Profile. In addition to providing essential security services, the Mobile Device
      includes the necessary security functionality to support configurations for these various use
      cases. Each use case may require additional configuration and applications to achieve the
      desired security. A selection of these use cases is elaborated below. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      Several of the use case templates include objective requirements that are strongly desired for
      the indicated use cases. Readers can expect those requirements to be made mandatory in a

      functionality in products in the near-term. <htm:br/><htm:br/> As of publication of this

      called Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE). This use case entails a significant
      degree of enterprise control over configuration and, possibly, software inventory. The
      enterprise elects to provide users with Mobile Devices and additional applications (such as
      VPN or email clients) in order to maintain control of their Enterprise data and security of
      their networks. Users may use Internet connectivity to browse the web or access corporate mail
      or run enterprise applications, but this connectivity may be under significant control of the

      tightly controlled configuration, and limited software inventory is appropriate for
      specialized, high-security use cases. For example, the device may not be permitted
      connectivity to any external peripherals. It may only be able to communicate via its Wi-Fi or
      cellular radios with the enterprise-run network, which may not even permit connectivity to the
      Internet. Use of the device may entail compliance with policies that are more restrictive than
      those in any general-purpose use case, yet may mitigate risks to highly sensitive information.
      As in the previous case, the enterprise will look for additional applications providing
      enterprise connectivity and services to have a similar level of assurance as the platform. <htm:br/><htm:br/>

            will be capable of communicating using one (or more) of these standard protocols: IPsec,
            DTLS, TLS, HTTPS, or Bluetooth. The protocols are specified by RFCs that offer a variety
            of implementation choices. Requirements have been imposed on some of these choices
            (particularly those for cryptographic primitives) to provide interoperability and
            resistance to cryptographic attack. <htm:br/><htm:br/>

        This section describes how keys are generated, derived, combined, released and destroyed. There are two major types of keys: DEKs and KEKs. (A REK is considered a KEK.)
         DEKs are used to protect data (as in the DAR protection described in FDP_DAR_EXT.1 and FDP_DAR_EXT.2). KEKs are used to protect other keys – DEKs, other KEKs, and other types of keys stored by the user or applications.
         The following diagram shows an example key hierarchy to illustrate the concepts of this profile. 
         This example is not meant as an approved design, but ST authors will be expected to provide a diagram illustrating their key hierarchy in order to demonstrate that they meet the requirements of this profile. 
         Please note if <xref to="uau_biometric"/> is selected in FIA_UAU.5.1, each BAF claimed in FIA_MBV_EXT.1.1 in the cPP-Module for Biometrics shall be illustrated in the key hierarchy diagram, to include a description of when and how the BAF is used to release keys.

                Revision 3 key establishment schemes using the following Function and Validity

                keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function (KDF). If key confirmation is
                supported, the evaluator shall also verify that the components of key confirmation
                have been implemented correctly, using the test procedures described below. This

                <htm:br/><htm:br/> The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement
                the key agreement schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall
                generate or obtain test vectors from a known good implementation of the TOE
                supported schemes. For each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role
                combination, KDF type, and, if supported, key confirmation role- key confirmation
                type combination, the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. The data set
                consists of one set of domain parameter values (FFC) or the NIST approved curve
                (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending
                on the scheme being tested. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The evaluator shall obtain the DKM,
                the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static and/or ephemeral), the MAC tag(s), and

                fields. <htm:br/><htm:br/> If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A
                Revision 3, the evaluator shall obtain only the public keys and the hashed value of
                the shared secret. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The evaluator shall verify the correctness of
                the TSF’s implementation of a given scheme by using a known good implementation to

                hashes or MAC tags generated from these values.<htm:br/><htm:br/> If key
                confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each implemented
                approved MAC algorithm. <htm:br/><htm:br/>

                another party’s valid and invalid key agreement results with or without key
                confirmation. To conduct this test, the evaluator shall obtain a list of the
                supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A Revision 3 key
                agreement implementation to determine which errors the TOE should be able to
                recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24 (FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors
                consisting of data sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves,
                the evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s public/private key pairs, MacTag, and any
                inputs used in the KDF, such as the other info and TOE id fields. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
                The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE
                recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being
                incorrect: the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the
                data to be MACed, or the generated MacTag. If the TOE contains the full or partial
                (only ECC) public key validation, the evaluator will also individually inject errors
                in both parties’ static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the
                TOE’s static private key to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key
                validation function and/or the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At
                least two of the test vectors shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in
                valid key agreement results (they should pass). <htm:br/><htm:br/> The TOE shall use
                these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme using the
                corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results with the
                results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects these
                errors. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
                <htm:h3>SP800-56B Key Establishment Schemes</htm:h3> The evaluator shall verify that
                the TSS describes whether the TOE acts as a sender, a recipient, or both for

                the following evaluation activity shall be performed to ensure the proper operation
                of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based key establishment scheme: <htm:br/>
                To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a
                known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
                supported key establishment scheme and its options (with or without key confirmation
                if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key confirmation
                is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is
                supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test vector
                shall include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any additional

                any additional input parameters if applicable, the MacTag in cases where key
                confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector,

                and ensure that the outputted plaintext keying material (KeyData) is equivalent to

                of any outputted or logged error message or through timing variations. If KTS-OAEP

              step as described in Section 5 of SP 800-56C is followed by Key Expansion using the

                to ensure that each key (DEKs, software-based key storage, and KEKs) is encrypted by
                keys of equal or greater security strength using one of the selected
                methods.<htm:br/><htm:br/> The evaluator shall review the TSS to verify that it
                contains a description of the conditioning used to derive KEKs. This description must

            <note role="application">Per NIST SP 800-131A, SHA-1 for generating digital signatures
              is no longer allowed, and SHA-1 for verification of digital signatures is strongly
              discouraged as there may be risk in accepting these signatures. It is expected that
              vendors will implement SHA-2 algorithms in accordance with SP
              800-131A.<htm:br/><htm:br/> SHA-1 is currently required in order to comply with the
              WLAN Client Extended Package. Vendors are strongly encouraged to implement updated
              protocols that support the SHA-2 family; until updated protocols are supported, this
              PP allows support for SHA-1 implementations in compliance with SP
              800-131A.<htm:br/><htm:br/> The intent of this requirement is to specify the hashing
              function. The hash selection must support the message digest size selection. The hash
              selection should be consistent with the overall strength of the algorithm used (for
              example, SHA 256 for 128-bit keys). <htm:br/><htm:br/> The TSF hashing functions can
              be implemented in one of two modes. The first mode is the byte­oriented mode. In this
              mode the TSF only hashes messages that are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e.
              the length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is
              the bit­oriented mode. In this mode the TSF hashes messages of arbitrary length. The
              TSF may implement either bit-oriented or byte-oriented; both implementations are not
              required. </note>

                indicates if the hashing function is implemented in bit-oriented and/or

              author selects the appropriate number of bits of entropy that corresponds to the
              greatest security strength of the algorithms included in the ST. Security strength is
              defined in Tables 2 and 3 of NIST SP 800-57A. For example, if the implementation
              includes 2048-bit RSA (security strength of 112 bits), AES 128 (security strength 128
              bits), and HMAC-SHA-256 (security strength 256 bits), then the ST author would select
              256 bits. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The ST author may select either software or hardware
              noise sources. A hardware noise source is a component that produces data that cannot
              be explained by a deterministic rule, due to its physical nature. In other words, a
              hardware based noise source generates sequences of random numbers from a physical
              process that cannot be predicted. For example, a sampled ring oscillator consists of
              an odd number of inverter gates chained into a loop, with an electrical pulse
              traveling from inverter to inverter around the loop. The inverters are not clocked, so
              the precise time required for a complete circuit around the loop varies slightly as
              various physical effects modify the small delay time at each inverter on the line to
              the next inverter. This variance results in an approximate natural frequency that
              contains drift and jitter over time. The output of the ring oscillator consists of the
              oscillating binary value sampled at a constant rate from one of the inverters – a rate
              that is significantly slower than the oscillator’s natural frequency. </note>

	    A subset of the User Data Protection focuses on protecting Data-At-Rest, namely FDP_DAR_EXT.1 and FDP_DAR_EXT.2.
            Three levels of data-at-rest protection are addressed: TSF data, Protected Data (and keys), and sensitive data.

          All keys, protected data, and sensitive data must ultimately be protected by the REK. Sensitive data must be protected by the password in addition to the REK. In particular, <xref to="Keys"/> has KEKs protected according to these requirements: DEK_1 would be appropriate for sensitive data, DEK_2 would not be appropriate for sensitive data, K_1 is not considered a sensitive key, and K_2 is considered a sensitive key. <htm:br/><htm:br/> 
          These requirements include a capability for encrypting sensitive data received while in the locked state, which may be considered a separate sub-category of sensitive data. This capability may be met by a key transport scheme (RSA) by using a public key to encrypt the DEK while protecting the corresponding private key with a password-derived or biometric-unlocked KEK. <htm:br/><htm:br/> 
          This capability may also be met by a key agreement scheme. To do so, the device generates a device-wide sensitive data asymmetric pair (the private key of which is protected by a password-derived or biometric-unlocked KEK) and an asymmetric pair for the received sensitive data to be stored. In order to store the sensitive data, the device-wide public key and data private key are used to generate a shared secret, which can be used as a KEK or a DEK. The data private key and shared secret are cleared after the data is encrypted and the data public key stored. Thus, no key material is available in the locked state to decrypt the newly stored data. Upon unlock, the device-wide private key is decrypted and is used with each data public key to regenerate the shared secret and decrypt the stored data.

                    sniffing tool between the wireless access point and an Internet-connected

                    examine the traffic from both step one and step two to verify that all Data
                    Plane traffic is encapsulated by IPsec, modulo the exceptions identified in the SFR (if applicable). For each exception listed in the SFR, the evaluator shall verify that that traffic is allowed outside of the VPN tunnel. The evaluator shall examine the Security
                    Parameter Index (SPI) value present in the encapsulated packets captured in Step
                    two from the TOE to the Gateway and shall verify this value is the same for all

                    the SPI value for packets from the Gateway to the TOE is different than the SPI
                    value for packets from the TOE to the Gateway. The evaluator shall be aware that
                    IP traffic on the cellular baseband outside of the IPsec tunnel may be emanating
                    from the baseband processor and shall verify with the manufacturer that any
                    identified traffic is not emanating from the application processor.

                    to the IP address of another device on the local wireless network and shall
                    verify that no packets are sent using the sniffing tool. The evaluator shall

              selected in FIA_UAU.5.1, it is acceptable for each modality to have a different FAR
              and FRR. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The False Accept Rate (FAR) is the measure of the
              likelihood that the biometric will incorrectly accept an authentication attempt by an
              unauthorized user. A system's FAR typically is stated as the proportion of
              verification transactions with wrongful claims of identity that are incorrectly
              confirmed. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The False Reject Rate (FRR) is the measure of the
              likelihood that the biometric security system will incorrectly reject an
              authentication attempt by an authorized user. A system's FRR typically is stated as
              the proportion of verification transactions with truthful claims of identity that are
              incorrectly denied. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Please note that without the use of hybrid
              authentication, multiple authentication attempts for a BAF that is claimed to have a
              one-attempt FAR between 1:100 and 1:500 inclusive will not produce an acceptable SAFAR
              in meeting FIA_BMG_EXT.1.2. More generally, depending on the number of authentication
              attempts allowed for the BAF, the claimed FAR must be strong (or equivalently, low)
              enough so that the SAFAR chosen in FIA_BMG_EXT.1.2 can be met within the 1% margin
              mandated. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Generally testing environments for a biometric system in
              a mobile device are based on a single legitimate user enrolling and test subjects
              attempt to authenticate. Since a thorough evaluation for FAR and FRR meeting all the
              conditions of statistical independence is not feasible in the time frame of CC
              evaluations and in agreement with ISO/IEC 19795, the use of offline testing is
              acceptable even if this causes the biometric system to deviate slightly from the
              evaluated configuration. Additionally, full cross-comparison (i.e. all test subjects
              are compared to non-self) is acceptable. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Detailed explanations

              False Accept Rate (SAFAR) is defined by the combination of individual error rates for
              each authentication factor and attempts used for access to a single session on the
              device. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Accessing a single session may involve a single
              authentication factor, in which case the SAFAR for a single attempt will be equal to
              the false accept rate (FAR) of that authentication factor and the SAFAR for n attempts
              will be $1-\left(1-FAR\right)^n$, assuming independence. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Accessing
              a single session on the device may involve the ability to use multiple authentication
              factors. It may be the case that only one authentication factor is needed to access a
              single session on the device (i.e. both a password and a BAF can be used, but only one
              is needed) or that both authentication factors are needed to access a single session
              on the device (i.e. both the BAF and a PIN must be entered). The full equations for
              calculating the SAFAR can be found in <xref to="biometric3"/>. A fully
              worked-out example that applies the equations in <xref to="biometric3"/> for
              calculating the SAFAR can be found in <xref to="biometric4"/>.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/> The worst-case scenario must be used to calculate the SAFAR. Thus
              the authentication factor with the highest FAR must be used for the maximum number of
              authentication attempts allowed for that factor. If any authentication attempts
              remain, then the authentication factor with the second highest FAR is used for the
              maximum number of authentication attempts allowed for that factor and so on. For
              example, the TOE supports a password and a BAF, the FAR for the BAF is higher than the
              FAR for the password and each authentication factor utilizes a shared counter per
              FIA_AFL_EXT.1. Then the worst-case scenario is the BAF is utilized for the maximum
              number of authentication attempts allowed for the BAF. For any remaining
              authentication attempts allowed the password is utilized. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Another
              example is the TOE supports a password and two BAFs, where the BAFs have different
              FARs, with both FARs being higher than the password FAR. Then the worst-case scenario
              is that the BAF with the highest FAR is used for the maximum number of authentication
              attempts allowed for that BAF, followed by the second BAF if any authentication
              attempts are allowed for that BAF. If any authentication attempts remain, then the
              password is utilized for those attempts. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The 1% margin is included
              for cases where a BAF is not a critical authentication factor and thus both BAF and
              password can be used in a session without exceeding the declared SAFAR.

                publication of this PP. Once the ISO standard is published, it shall be used to meet
                the evaluation activity for this requirement. Henniger, Scheuermann, and Kniess <xref
                  to="IBPC"/>, provide a description of attack potential calculation with
                examples. Until such time as ISO 19989 is published, the vendor shall provide to the
                lab a description of the PAD processing implemented in the TSF, test procedures used
                to validate successful operation of PAD, and test data with results of the PAD
                validation testing. The lab may analyze the test procedures and data to validate
                vendor test results or, optionally, may conduct its own testing. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
                If the lab performs its own testing, it is highly recommended that the vendor
                provides spoof testing tools, as it is not expected for the lab to create a test
                procedure for modalities outside of established standards and easily implemented
                procedures. Labs can also expedite the testing process by purchasing the appropriate
                spoof kits and recipes from specialized biometrics testing labs.</Tests>

OCSP stapling and OCSP multi-stapling only support TLS server certificate validation. If other certificate types are validated, either OCSP or CRL should be claimed. The WLAN Client EP to which a MDF TOE must also conform requires that certificates are used for EAP-TLS; this use requires that the extendedKeyUsage rules are verified. Certificates may optionally be used for trusted updates of system software and applications (FPT_TUD_EXT.2) and for integrity verification (FPT_TST_EXT.2(1)) and, if implemented, must be validated to contain the Code Signing purpose extendedKeyUsage.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
              While FIA_X509_EXT.1.1 requires that the TOE perform certain checks on the certificate presented by a TLS server, there are corresponding checks that the authentication server will have to perform on the certificate presented by the client; namely that the extendedKeyUsage field of the client certificate includes “Client Authentication” and that the key agreement bit (for the Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites) or the key encipherment bit (for RSA ciphersuites) be set. Certificates obtained for use by the TOE will have to conform to these requirements in order to be used in the enterprise. This check is required to support EAP-TLS for the WLAN Client EP.</note>

        Both the user and the administrator may manage the TOE. This administrator is likely to be acting remotely and could be the Mobile Device Management (MDM) Administrator acting through an MDM Agent. <htm:br/><htm:br/> 
        The Administrator is responsible for management activities, including setting the policy that is applied by the enterprise on the Mobile Device. These management functions are likely to be a different set than those management functions provided to the user. Management functions that are provided to the user and not the administrator are listed in FMT_MOF_EXT.1.1. Management functions for which the administrator may adopt a policy that restricts the user from performing that function are listed in FMT_MOF_EXT.1.2. <htm:br/><htm:br/> 
        <xref to="fmt_smf"/> compares the management functions required by this Protection Profile in the following three requirements (FMT_MOF_EXT.1.1, FMT_MOF_EXT.1.2, and FMT_SMF_EXT.1).

                    to entering the necessary password to complete the boot process, waiting 5
                    minutes after the device is fully booted. The evaluator shall observe that RF
                    spikes are present at the expected uplink channel frequency. The evaluator shall
                    clear the "Max Hold" on the spectrum analyzer. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Step 3: The
                    evaluator shall verify the absence of RF activity for the uplink channel when
                    the radio in question is disabled. The evaluator shall complete the following
                    test five times. The evaluator shall power on the device, ensure the radio in
                    question is disabled, power off the device, enable "Max Hold" on the spectrum
                    analyzer and power on the device. The evaluator shall wait 2 minutes at each
                    Authentication Factor interface prior to entering the necessary password to
                    complete the boot process, waiting 5 minutes after the device is fully booted.
                    The evaluator shall clear the "Max Hold" on the spectrum analyzer. If the radios 
                    are used for device initialization, then a spike of RF activity for the uplink channel
                    can be observed initially at device boot. However, if a spike of
                    RF activity for the uplink channel of the specific radio frequency band is
                    observed after the device is fully booted or at an Authentication Factor interface 
                    it is deemed that the radio is enabled.

		  <app-note>The assignment in function <_/>
              consists of at least one audio and/or visual device, such as camera and microphone,
              which can be enabled and disabled by either the user or administrator. Disablement of
              the microphone does not imply that the microphone may not be enabled in order to place
              emergency phone calls. If certain devices are able to be restricted to the enterprise
              (either device-wide, per-app or per-group of applications) and others are able to be
              restricted to users, then this function should be iterated in the table with the
              appropriate table entries.
	      <htm:p>
		Regarding functions <xref to="mf-radios"/> and <xref to="mf-audioVisual"/>,
		disablement of a particular
              radio or audio/visual device must be effective as soon as the TOE has power.
              Disablement must also apply when the TOE is booted into auxiliary boot modes, for
              example, associated with updates or backup. If the TOE supports states in which
              security management policy is inaccessible, for example, due to data-at-rest
              protection, it is acceptable to meet this requirement by ensuring that these devices
              are disabled by default while in these states. That these devices are disabled during
              auxiliary boot modes does not imply that the device (particularly the cellular radio)
              may not be enabled in order to perform emergency phone calls.

		      For function <xref to="mf-update"/>, the administrator capability to update the system
		      software may be limited to causing a prompt to the user to update rather than the
		      ability to initiate the update itself. As the administrator is likely to be acting
		      remotely, he/she would be unaware of inopportune situations, such as low power, which
		      may cause the update to fail and the device to become inoperable. The user can refuse
		      to accept the update in such situations. It is expected that system architects will be
		      cognizant of this limitation and will enforce network access controls in order to
		      enforce enterprise-critical updates.

              to be implemented. The ST author should select which Optional functions are
              implemented. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The third column (FMT_MOF_EXT.1.1) indicates functions
              that are to be restricted to the user (i.e. not available to the administrator).
              <htm:br/><htm:br/> The fourth column (Administrator) indicates functions that are
              available to the administrator. The functions restricted to the user (column 3) cannot
              also be available to the administrator. Functions available to the administrator can
              still be available to the user, as long as the function is not restricted to the

              indicated policy. If the function is restricted to the administrator the function is
              not available to the user. This does not prevent the user from modifying a setting to
              make the function stricter, but the user cannot undo the configuration enforced by the
              administrator. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The ST author may use a table in the ST, listing

              sub-functions not in a selection are also mandatory and any assignments must contain
              at least one assigned value. For functions that are optional and contain an assignment
              or selection, at least one value must be assigned/selected to be included in the ST.
              For non-selectable sub-functions in an optional function, all sub-functions must be
              implemented in order for the function to be included. For functions with a "per-app
              basis" sub function and an assignment, the ST author must indicate which assigned
              features are manageable on a per-app basis and which are not by iterating the row.

              Protected data is all non-TSF data, including all user or enterprise data. Some or all

			  If <xref to="s-smf-wipe-pro"/> is selected it is assumed that the sensitive data is wiped as well.
			  However, if <xref to="s-smf-wipe-sen"/> is selected, it does not imply that all non-TSF data (protected data)
              is wiped.
			  If <xref to="s-smf-wipe-pro"/> or <xref to="s-smf-wipe-sen"/> is selected the wipe  must be in accordance with FCS_CKM_EXT.5.1.
			  Thus cryptographically wiping the device is an acceptable remediation action.

      The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) in <xref to="sfr"/> are a formal
      instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP identifies the Security Assurance
      Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation
      applicable for the evaluation and performs independent testing.<htm:br/><htm:br/> This section
      lists the set of SARs from CC part 3 that are required in evaluations against this PP.
      Individual Evaluation Activities to be performed are specified both in <xref to="sfr"/>
      as well as in this section. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The general model for evaluation of TOEs
      against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows:<htm:br/><htm:br/> After the ST has
      been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF will obtain the
      TOE, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for the TOE. The ITSEF is
      expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) for the ASE
      and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Evaluation Activities contained within <xref
        to="sfr"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM evaluation
      requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the TOE. The Evaluation
      Activities that are captured in <xref to="sfr"/> also provide clarification as to what
      the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the TOE is compliant with the PP.

              high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be followed to achieve
              those objectives. These procedures include expected results. The test report (which
              could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details the activities that took
              place when the test procedures were executed, and includes the actual results of the
              tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a test run that resulted in
              a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of the test, the report would
              show a "fail" and "pass" result (and the supporting details), and not just the "pass"
              result.</aactivity>

      <sec:ava title="Class AVA: Vulnerability Assessment"> For the current generation
        of this protection profile, the evaluation lab is expected to survey open sources to
        discover what vulnerabilities have been discovered in these types of products. In most
        cases, these vulnerabilities will require sophistication beyond that of a basic attacker.
        Until penetration tools are created and uniformly distributed to the evaluation labs, the
        evaluator will not be expected to test for these vulnerabilities in the TOE. The labs will
        be expected to comment on the likelihood of these vulnerabilities given the documentation
        provided by the vendor. This information will be used in the development of penetration
        testing tools and for the development of future protection profiles.

  <appendix id="entropy" title="Entropy Documentation And Assessment"> 
    The documentation of the
    entropy source should be detailed enough that, after reading, the evaluator will thoroughly
    understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide entropy. This
    documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design description, entropy
    justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation is not required to
    be part of the TSS. 
    <section id="description" title="Design Description">
      Documentation shall
      include the design of the entropy source as a whole, including the interaction of all entropy
      source components. It will describe the operation of the entropy source to include how it
      works, how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the
      entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source
      design indicating where the random comes from, where it is passed next, any post-processing of
      the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how it is output from
      the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking) should also be
      described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> This design must also include a description of the content of the security
      boundary of the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an
      adversary outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate. <htm:br/><htm:br/> If
      implemented, the design description shall include a description of how third-party
      applications can add entropy to the RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between
      power-off and power-on shall be included. </section>
    <section id="justification" title="Entropy Justification"> 
      There should be a technical argument
      for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence in the
      entropy source exhibiting probabilistic behavior (an explanation of the probability
      distribution and justification for that distribution given the particular source is one way to
      describe this). This argument will include a description of the expected entropy rate and
      explain how you ensure that sufficient entropy is going into the TOE randomizer seeding
      process. This discussion will be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be
      relied upon to produce bits with entropy. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The entropy justification shall
      not include any data added from any third-party application or from any state saving between
      restarts. </section>
    <section id="conditions" title="Operating Conditions"> 
      Documentation will also include the range
      of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. It
      will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the
      entropy source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall
      describe the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction or become
      inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included. </section>
    <section id="testing" title="Health Testing"> 
      More specifically, all entropy source health tests
      and their rationale will be documented. This will include a description of the health tests,
      the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at startup,
      continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, and rationale
      indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in
      the entropy source.</section>

    <section id="biometric1" title="Experimental Setups And Error Bars In Testing FAR And FRR">
      <sec:sub1 title="Introduction"> For the purposes of this PP, FIA_BMG_EXT.1
		requires testing for FAR, FRR and SAFAR if a BAF is included in
        the TOE. In this version of the PP it is expected that the vendor will provide evidence to
        the evaluator of the testing completed to support the claimed FAR and FRR. This Appendix
        provides a guide to how this testing could be done and to what error bars are expected when
        the Rule of 3 is applied. This guide should be treated as a reference and not as a NIAP
        mandate, requirement, or set of mandates or requirements. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      </sec:sub1>
      <sec:sub2 title="Testing environment that could meet FIA_BMG_EXT.1.1"> In
        performing tests for FAR and FRR, ISO/IEC 19795-1 recommends that vendors or testing labs
        use the largest test population that can be reasonably managed. Generally, testing
        environments for mobile devices are based upon individual devices with their own local
        authentication templates/profiles where the submitted biometric samples are destroyed after
        submission. It is infeasible to meet the given time frame for CC evaluations of mobile
        devices if offline testing is not supported. Either online or offline testing is acceptable.
        The number of test subjects needed to support a claimed FAR and FRR, will depend on if
        online or offline testing is used due to how the subjects are compared. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
        If online testing is utilized, it is expected that the testing is conducted directly on the
        TOE. The legitimate user will enroll on the TOE and all test subjects will be compared to
        only the legitimate user. Thus if the target FAR is 1:100, at least 300 independent samples
        shall be used corresponding to 300 users and at least 300 independent trials are required in
        testing this FAR. It is acceptable that multiple TOEs, each with a different legitimate
        user, could be used to reduce the number of test subjects needed for online testing. With
        the assumption that the test subjects are compared against all legitimate users and no
        legitimate users are counted as test subjects, if <htm:i>N<htm:sub>D</htm:sub></htm:i>
        devices are used, the number of test subjects needed can be divided by
            <htm:i>N<htm:sub>D</htm:sub></htm:i>. <htm:br/><htm:br/> If offline testing is used, it
        is expected that the biometric system used for testing will not be in the evaluated
        configuration of the TOE to allow for a full cross-comparison, in which the biometric sample
        from the test subjects is compared with every non-self template. It is expected, that the
        biometric system used for testing will collect samples and generate templates exactly the
        same as the biometric system in the TOE. However, even though the comparison to determine if
        a valid sample is provided (i.e. matching algorithm) should remain the same, it is
        acceptable if the biometric system is modified to complete a full cross-comparison. Per
        ISO/IEC 19795, these comparisons will not be statistically independent, but this approach is
        statistically unbiased. Additionally, offline testing with a full cross-comparison greatly
        reduces the number of test subjects needed. If there are
          <htm:i>N<htm:sub>U</htm:sub></htm:i> users, the number of available individual independent
        comparisons will be <htm:i>N<htm:sub>U</htm:sub>*(N<htm:sub>U</htm:sub>-1)/2</htm:i>. Thus
        if the target FAR is 1:10000, only 246 test subjects are needed if offline testing of a full
        cross-comparison is used. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      </sec:sub2>
      <sec:sub3 title="Deriving False Accept Rate"> To expedite approval while
        maintaining a statistically valid result, it is required for the vendor or independent lab
        to perform testing using <htm:i>three</htm:i> times the sample size, at a minimum, i.e. the
        "Rule of 3" for the number of trials. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Three times the sample size
        corresponds to 90% confidence and <htm:i>c</htm:i> = 0.95 (rounded, worst-case), where
          <htm:i>c</htm:i> is a percentage/fraction of the intended false error rate (either FAR or
        FRR) for which the error bar is calculated. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The parameters associated
        with the Rule of 3 are derived by treating a biometric test, consisting of many comparisons,
        as a series of Bernoulli trials. <htm:br/><htm:br/> As shown in the tables below, the error
        bar may be large if a higher false error rate is declared. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The table

    <section id="biometric2" title="Derivation of the Rule of 3 (and similar rules, for completeness)"> 
      A biometric test
      can be treated as a series of Bernoulli trials for which a binomial distribution of the number
      of successes and failures is assumed. When calculating an error interval for which a binomial
      distribution is assumed, one confidence interval (denoted
        <htm:i>I<htm:sub>conf</htm:sub></htm:i>) that is widely used is the standard Wald interval,
      expressed in Equation (1) as: <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      $$\left(p-z_{α/2}&#x221a;\frac{p\left(1-p\right)}{n}\right)&#x2264;I_{conf}&#x2264;
      \left(p+z_{α/2}&#x221a;\frac{p\left(1-p\right)}{n}\right)\quad\quad(1)$$ 
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      where <htm:i>p = X/n</htm:i> is the sample proportion of successes (or error in this case),
          <htm:i>z<htm:sub>α/2</htm:sub></htm:i> is the 100(1 – α/2)th percentile of the standard
      normal distribution, and <htm:i>n</htm:i> is the number of trials. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Although
      intervals such as the Wilson, Agresti-Coull, and Jeffreys intervals are recommended by Brown
      et al., biometrics testing in practice rests on the derivation of the Rule of 30 based on the
      Wald distribution <xref to="Brown"/>. However, because of the large sample size, number
      of test subjects, and number of trials required for the Rule of 30, this PP mandates the Rule
      of 3 to make testing more feasible. <htm:br/><htm:br/> In simpler form, this refers to a
      confidence interval with error <htm:i>E</htm:i> expressed as: <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      $$E=z_{α/2}&#x221a;\frac{p\left(1-p\right)}{n}\quad\quad(2)$$ <htm:br/><htm:br/> Rearranging
      the equation to express the number of trials, <htm:i>n</htm:i>, in terms of error
        <htm:i>E</htm:i>, this expression becomes: <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      $$n=\left(\frac{z_{α/2}}{E}\right)^2p\left(1-p\right)\quad\quad(3)$$ <htm:br/><htm:br/> In
      practice, <htm:i>E</htm:i> is expressed as a proportion of the error probability as:
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> $$E = cp\quad\quad(4)$$ <htm:br/><htm:br/> Thus, <htm:i>n</htm:i> finally
      becomes: <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      $$n=\left(\frac{z_{α/2}}{c}\right)^2\frac{\left(1-p\right)}{p}\quad\quad(5)$$
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> For a 90% confidence interval, <htm:i>z<htm:sub>α/2</htm:sub></htm:i> =
      1.6449, while for a 95% confidence interval, <htm:i>z<htm:sub>α/2</htm:sub></htm:i> = 1.96.
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> Thus it is easy to see that for a 90% confidence interval with
        <htm:i>c</htm:i> = 0.95: <htm:br/><htm:br/> $$\left ( \frac{1.6449}{0.95}\right )^{2}= 2.998
      &#x2248; 3\quad\quad(6)$$ <htm:br/><htm:br/> which confirms the rule of 3 and completes our
      derivation. </section>
    <section id="biometric3" title="SAFAR Calculation Equations"> A number of equations can be used
      in calculating SAFAR. A fully-worked example that applies the equations below can be found in
        <xref to="biometric4"/>. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The SAFAR for a single authentication
      factor is calculated as $SAFAR=1-\left(1-FAR\right)^{attempts allowed}$. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      Thus let <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>i</htm:sub></htm:i> be the SAFAR for the
          <htm:i>i<htm:sup>th</htm:sup></htm:i> authentication factor where
          <htm:i>n<htm:sub>i</htm:sub></htm:i> is the number of authentication attempts allowed for
      the given factor, treated individually as a separate authentication system, which can be
      expressed as <htm:br/><htm:br/> $$SAFAR_i=1-\left(1-FAR_i\right)^{ni},\quad\quad (1)$$
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> assuming each attempt is independent. <htm:br/><htm:br/> If multiple
      authentication factors are required (with all to pass), i.e. password plus biometric factor,
      the SAFAR for a single attempt will be the product of each individual factor’s false accept
      rate, assuming each attempt is independent. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Thus, for a hybrid combination
      of <htm:i>m</htm:i> PIN/password and biometric factors (denoted with index <htm:i>j</htm:i>)
      with <htm:i>n<htm:sub>i</htm:sub></htm:i> attempts allowed, treated collectively as an
      individual authentication factor in a separate authentication system, the SAFAR can be
      expressed as: <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      $$SAFAR_i=1-\left(1-&#x220f;^m_{j=1}FAR_j\right)^{ni},\quad\quad (2)$$ <htm:br/> assuming each
      attempt is independent. Because this is currently associated with a PIN/password and

      <htm:i>Password and fingerprint authentication example:</htm:i>
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> Suppose the overall authentication system consists of two authentication
      factors: a four character password factor allowing for ten attempts and a fingerprint
      biometric factor with an FAR of 1:1000 allowing for five attempts. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      Passwords utilize the minimum character set of 63 characters, plus one additional accepted

      <htm:ol type="a">
        <htm:li>The SAFAR for a four-character password allowing for ten attempts, utilizing a 64
          character set, is: <htm:br/><htm:br/> $$SAFAR_{\left(password|10 attempts\right)} = 1 -

          \left(rounded\right)$$ <htm:br/> The SAFAR for a fingerprint biometric factor with an FAR
          of 1:1000, allowing for five attempts, is: <htm:br/><htm:br/> $$SAFAR_{\left(fingerprint|5
          attempts\right)} = 1 - \left(1 - FAR \right)^{attempts}$$ $$SAFAR_{\left(fingerprint|5
          attempts\right)} = 1 - \left(1 - 10 ^{-3}\right)^{5}=4.990 * 10^{-3}
          \left(rounded\right)$$ <htm:br/>
        </htm:li>
        <htm:li> If the user is only allowed to pick one factor, the overall SAFAR is that of the
          weakest one, which is <htm:br/><htm:br/> $$SAFAR_{\left(fingerprint|5 attempts\right)} =
          4.990 * 10^{-3}$$ <htm:br/>
        </htm:li>
        <htm:li> If the user can authenticate using any authentication factor in an authentication
          session, the overall SAFAR is:<htm:br/><htm:br/> $$SAFAR_{any} = 1 - \left(1 - \left(5.96
          * 10^{-7}\right)\right) * \left(1-\left(4.99 * 10 ^{-3}\right)\right)$$ $$= 4.991 * 10{-3}
          (rounded)$$ <htm:br/>
        </htm:li>
        <htm:li> If the conditions are the same as in c) but with password as a critical factor, the
          worst-case scenario is the same as in c) in that the password factor is picked last, thus
          <htm:br/><htm:br/> $$SAFAR_{any password critical} = 4.991* 10^{-3} \left(rounded\right)$$
          <htm:br/>
        </htm:li>
        <htm:li> If password and fingerprint are now required factors, the SAFAR for fingerprint has
          to be recalculated for ten attempts: <htm:br/><htm:br/> $$SAFAR_{fingerprint|10 attempts}
          = 1 - \left(1-10^{-3}\right)^{10} = 9.955 * 10 ^{-3} \left(rounded\right)$$
          <htm:br/><htm:br/> Since the SAFAR for password with ten attempts allowed is known, it
          then follows that: <htm:br/><htm:br/> $$SAFAR_{fingerprint+password} =
          \left(5.960*10^{-7}\right) * \left(9.955*10^{-3}\right) = 5.933 * 10^{-9}
          \left(rounded\right)$$ <htm:br/> The risk of providing authentication feedback is that if
          either authentication factor is compromised, the same sample can then be used by the
          adversary for every authentication after, thus reducing the SAFAR for the system to that
          of the other authentication factor. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
        </htm:li>
        <htm:li> If password/PIN and fingerprint are now combined into a single hybrid factor, the
          SAFAR is as follows: <htm:br/><htm:br/> $$SAFAR_{fingerprint+password|10 attempts} = 1 -
          \left(1-2^{-6*4}*10^{-3}\right)^{10}$$ $$=5.960 * 10 ^{-10} \left(rounded\right)$$
          <htm:br/> This is more secure than e) because not only are there less attempts overall
          before the maximum count is exceeded (10 instead of 20), the adversary would not know if a
          sample submitted for either factor results in authentication unless the presentation of
          both factors results in successful authentication. </htm:li>

<!-- Trusted Channels/RF protocols
  
WLAN -> WLAN Client Module
    - WLAN (specifically 802.11-2012,  802.1X, EAP-TLS) is mandatory to be included in a MDF ST, FTP_ITC_EXT.1.1 mandates it 
        - TODO: Determine if this wording needs to change when WLAN Client is updated to module
    - Mapping to threat/objectives -> in WLAN Client Module
    - Audit -> in WLAN Client Module 

Bluetooth -> Bluetooth Module
    - Bluetooth is mandatory to be included in a MDF ST (if HW exists), FDP_UPC_EXT.1/BLUETOOTH mandates BR/EDR but LE is selecatable 
    - Mapping to threat/objectives -> in MDF
    - Audit -> in BT Module
    - Still trying to determine where the line is drawn for what is in module and what stays in MDF b/c some of the "BT" SFRs are actually done by the OS
    - Mapping between MDF v3.1 and BT module - spreadsheet
                       
TLS -> TLS Package
    - TLS is mandatory to be included in MDF ST, FDP_UPC_EXT.1/APPS and FTP_ITC_EXT.1.1 mandates it
    - Mapping to threat/objectives -> in MDF
    - Audit -> in MDF
   
DTLS -> TLS Package
   - DTLS is NOT mandatory, but selectable in FDP_UPC_EXT.1/APPS and FTP_ITC_EXT.1.1
   - Mapping to threat/objectives -> in MDF
   - Audit -> in MDF
   
   IPSec -> VPN Client Module
   - IPSec is NOT mandatory, but selectable in FDP_UPC_EXT.1/APPS, FTP_ITC_EXT.1.1 and FDP_IFC_EXT.1.1
   - Flow contol (i.e. don't allow a split tunnel) is mandatory for the platform to implement (whether it be the native VPN client and/or a 3rd party application)
   - Mapping to threat/objectives -> in VPN Client Module
   - Audit -> in VPN Client Module (but currently objective)

  HTTPS -> MDF (but really covered in TLS Package)
  - HTTPS is mandatory (SFRs in Section 5) b/c FDP_UPC_EXT.1/APPS mandates it, also selectable in FTP_ITC_EXT.1.1
      - HTTPS SFRs in MDF (FCS_HTTPS_EXT.1.2) requires "implement HTTPS using TLS as defined in the Package for Transport Layer Security." 
  - Mapping to threat/objectives -> in MDF
  - Audit -> in MDF
  - Cert ->
      - If peer cert is deemed invalid, allow override (FCS_HTTPS_EXT.1.3 and FMT function ctr-id: CertInvalid)
      - If peer cert validity cannot be determined, __________

     1.1 = 1.1 - need to mandate that a ciphersuite other than SHA1 is selected. - do this just like MDM (and turn blind eye to the fact that FCS_COP.1 still allows SHA1)
     1.2 = 1.2
     1.3 ~ 1.3 - need to mandate selection "with no exceptions"
     1.4 (man) = 2.1 (sel-based) - mandating mutual auth to be selected so 2.1 becomes mandatory
     2.1 = 5.1
