<!-- Kevin:
what is this: <htm:div class="comp">
How is it differenet then me using section?
-->

<!-- TODO: 
 - <xref to="alwaysOnVPN"/> for the FMT_SMF functions display table prior to function number

- Open Issues on github
- HW Equivalency - see Dianne's email
- Fix biometric equations per example in PP template
       
-->

<!-- TODO v 3.3
- Update WLAN EP references to WLAN Module
- Remove SHA1 and any app notes about WLAN needing SHA 1
- <selectable exclusive="yes"> - for "no other" in any selection
-->


<!-- DONE:
  BT Module - need to update with the TRRT/TD
  - TRRTs with PP change needed
    - BT - keep SFRs mapped to MDF objectives, but need to update SFR numbers - DONE
    - Moved BT to implementation dependent - IF BT HW exists then mandatory, if BT HW does not exist then not mandatory 
          - Iterated FDP_UPC, removed BT from the mandatory iteration and iteration (just BT) in optional A.3 - implementation dependent. 
    - All TDs as of 2019_09_01
    - mutual auth required for TLS and DTLS
    -	EAs that include API documentation according to adv OR in entropy documentation – Just put at top of EA outside of TSS flag
    - Move FAU_GEN table 1 and 2 move out of the EA and into the application note 
    - Updated FMT_SMF function numbers to be ctr variables
    - selection for FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.3 and FCS_DTLS_EXT.1.3 (in package) to not allow exceptions for when server cert is invalid.  
   - MDF fcs_tlsc/dtls_ext.1.3 is similar to fcs_tlsc/dtls_ext.1.3 in package, but package has [selection: with no exceptions, except when override is authorized]. How do I specify which selection has to be made?? MDF: The <abbr linkend="TSF"/> shall not establish a trusted channel if the peer certificate is invalid. However, HTTPS requires different behavior, though HTTPS is implemented over TLS. This element addresses non-HTTPS TLS connections.
    - DONE: Added FMT_SMF Function 21 and added app note to HTTPS.1.3
-->

<!-- TODO_Future:
 - cert stapling:
      - OSCP stapling for establishing the WLAN connection
      - Can this fix the what to do when a connection is not available to verify the validity?
 - EA for radio testing
     -	FMT_SMF_EXT.1 Function 4 AA – need to fix it with respect to setting up the testing environment setup (RF noise floor, sweeping frequency…) and to address power up spikes (power to the radio before realizing that the device is in Airplane mode for both cellular and wifi)
     - Technical Query 839: FCS_STG_EXT.2.2 (and interaction with 3.1)

- <selectable id= " "/> and selection depends ids for the selectable SFRs

    <section title="TOE Overview" id="toeov"> This assurance standard specifies information security
      requirements for Mobile Devices for use in an enterprise. A Mobile Device in the context of
      this assurance standard is a device, which is composed of a hardware platform and its system
      software. The device typically provides wireless connectivity
      <!-- Future: expand on what RF wireless includes -->and may include software for functions
      like secure messaging, email, web, VPN connection, and VoIP (Voice over IP), for access to the
      protected enterprise network, enterprise data and applications, and for communicating to other
      Mobile Devices. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      <xref to="NetEnv"/> illustrates the network operating environment of the Mobile Device. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      <figure entity="images/figure1.jpg" title="Mobile Device Network Environment" id="NetEnv"/>
      <htm:br/>
      <htm:br/> Examples of a "Mobile Device" that should claim conformance to this Protection
      Profile include smartphones, tablet computers, and other Mobile Devices with similar
      capabilities. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The Mobile Device provides essential services, such as
      cryptographic services, data-at-rest protection, and key storage services to support the
      secure operation of applications on the device. Additional security features such as security
      policy enforcement, application mandatory access control, anti-exploitation features, user
      authentication, and software integrity protection are implemented in order to address threats.
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> This assurance standard describes these essential security services
      provided by the Mobile Device and serves as a foundation for a secure mobile architecture. The
      wireless connectivity shall be validated against the Extended Package for WLAN Client. If the
      mobile device contains Bluetooth functionality (i.e., has Bluetooth hardware), the Bluetooth
      connectivity shall be evaluated against the PP-Module for Bluetooth. As illustrated in <xref
        to="TOE"/>, it is expected that a typical deployment would also include either
      third-party or bundled components. Whether these components are bundled as part of the Mobile
      Device by the manufacturer or developed by a third-party, they must be separately validated
      against the related assurance standards such as the PP-Module for MDM Agent, PP-Module for VPN
      Client, and PP-Module for VVoIP. It is the responsibility of the architect of
      the overall secure mobile architecture to ensure validation of these components. Additional
      applications that may come pre-installed on the Mobile Device that are not validated are
      considered to be potentially flawed, but not malicious. Examples include email client and web
      browser. <htm:br/><htm:br/>

      cases. <xref to="use"/> provides use case templates that list those selections,
      assignments, and objective requirements that best support the use cases identified by this
      Protection Profile. In addition to providing essential security services, the Mobile Device
      includes the necessary security functionality to support configurations for these various use
      cases. Each use case may require additional configuration and applications to achieve the
      desired security. A selection of these use cases is elaborated below. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      Several of the use case templates include objective requirements that are strongly desired for
      the indicated use cases. Readers can expect those requirements to be made mandatory in a
      future revision of this protection profile, and industry should aim to include that security
      functionality in products in the near-term. <htm:br/><htm:br/> As of publication of this
      version of the Protection Profile, meeting the requirements in <xref to="sr"/> is
      necessary for all use cases. <htm:br/><htm:br/>

        general-purpose enterprise use and limited personal use</htm:b>
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> An enterprise-owned device for general-purpose business use is commonly
      called Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE). This use case entails a significant
      degree of enterprise control over configuration and, possibly, software inventory. The
      enterprise elects to provide users with Mobile Devices and additional applications (such as
      VPN or email clients) in order to maintain control of their Enterprise data and security of
      their networks. Users may use Internet connectivity to browse the web or access corporate mail
      or run enterprise applications, but this connectivity may be under significant control of the
      enterprise. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      <htm:b>[<ctr ctr-type="USE CASE" id="uc_enthisec"/>] Enterprise-owned device for specialized,
        high-security use</htm:b>
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> An enterprise-owned device with intentionally limited network connectivity,
      tightly controlled configuration, and limited software inventory is appropriate for
      specialized, high-security use cases. For example, the device may not be permitted
      connectivity to any external peripherals. It may only be able to communicate via its Wi-Fi or
      cellular radios with the enterprise-run network, which may not even permit connectivity to the
      Internet. Use of the device may entail compliance with policies that are more restrictive than
      those in any general-purpose use case, yet may mitigate risks to highly sensitive information.
      As in the previous case, the enterprise will look for additional applications providing
      enterprise connectivity and services to have a similar level of assurance as the platform. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      <htm:b>[<ctr ctr-type="USE CASE" id="uc_pergenpurp"/>] Personally-owned device for personal
        and enterprise use</htm:b>
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> A personally-owned device, which is used, for both personal activities and
      enterprise data is commonly called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). The device may be provisioned
      for access to enterprise resources after significant personal usage has occurred. Unlike in
      the enterprise-owned cases, the enterprise is limited in what security policies it can enforce
      because the user purchased the device primarily for personal use and is unlikely to accept
      policies that limit the functionality of the device. However, because the enterprise allows
      the user full (or nearly full) access to the enterprise network, the enterprise will require
      their own security controls to ensure that enterprise resources are protected from potential
      threats posed by the personal activities on the device. These controls could potentially be
      enforced by a separation mechanism built-in to the device itself to distinguish between
      enterprise and personal activities, or by a third-party application that provides access to
      enterprise resources and leverages security capabilities provided by the mobile device. Based
      upon the operational environment and the acceptable risk level of the enterprise, those
      security functional requirements outlined in <xref to="sr"/> of this PP along with the
      selections in the Use Case 3 template defined in <xref to="use"/> are sufficient for
      the secure implementation of this BYOD use case. <htm:br/><htm:br/>

      <htm:br/><htm:br/> A personally-owned device, which is used, for both personal activities and
      enterprise data is commonly called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). This device may be
      provisioned for limited access to enterprise resources such as enterprise email. Because the
      user does not have full access to the enterprise or enterprise data, the enterprise may not
      need to enforce any security policies on the device. However, the enterprise may want secure
      email and web browsing with assurance that the services being provided to those clients by the
      Mobile Device are not compromised. Based upon the operational environment and the acceptable
      risk level of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in <xref

          <description> To address the network eavesdropping (T.EAVESDROP) and network attack

            transmission of Enterprise and user data and configuration data between the TOE and
            remote network entities, conformant TOEs will use a trusted communication path. The TOE
            will be capable of communicating using one (or more) of these standard protocols: IPsec,
            DTLS, TLS, HTTPS, or Bluetooth. The protocols are specified by RFCs that offer a variety
            of implementation choices. Requirements have been imposed on some of these choices
            (particularly those for cryptographic primitives) to provide interoperability and
            resistance to cryptographic attack. <htm:br/><htm:br/> 
            While conformant TOEs must
            support all of the choices specified in the ST including any optional SFRs defined in
            this PP, they may support additional algorithms and protocols. If such additional
            mechanisms are not evaluated, guidance must be given to the administrator to make clear
            the fact that they were not evaluated. </description>

          <description> In a BYOD environment (use cases 3 and 4), a personally-owned mobile device
            is used for both personal activities and enterprise data. Enterprise management
            solutions may have the technical capability to monitor and enforce security policies on
            the device. However, the privacy of the personal activities and data must be ensured. In
            addition, since there are limited controls that the enterprise can enforce on the
            personal side, separation of personal and enterprise data is needed. This will protect

                (including enabling or disabling) of the mechanisms implemented in the TOE that are
                necessary to enforce the requirements specified in the PP. The evaluator shall
                document the methodology or approach taken while determining which actions in the
                administrative guide are security relevant with respect to this PP. The evaluator

              <Tests> The evaluator shall test the TOE’s ability to correctly generate audit records

                and administrative actions. This should include all instances of an event. The
                evaluator shall test that audit records are generated for the establishment and
                termination of a channel for each of the cryptographic protocols contained in the
                ST. For administrative actions, the evaluator shall test that each action determined
                by the evaluator above to be security relevant in the context of this PP is
                auditable. When verifying the test results, the evaluator shall ensure the audit
                records generated during testing match the format specified in the administrative
                guide, and that the fields specified in FAU_GEN.1.2 are contained in each audit
                record. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Note that the testing here can be accomplished in
                conjunction with the testing of the security mechanisms directly. For example,
                testing performed to ensure that the administrative guidance provided is correct
                verifies that AGD_OPE.1 is satisfied and should address the invocation of the
                administrative actions that are needed to verify the audit records are generated as

        This section describes how keys are generated, derived, combined, released and destroyed. There are two major types of keys: DEKs and KEKs. (A REK is considered a KEK.) DEKs are used to protect data (as in the DAR protection described in FDP_DAR_EXT.1 and FDP_DAR_EXT.2). KEKs are used to protect other keys – DEKs, other KEKs, and other types of keys stored by the user or applications. The following diagram shows an example key hierarchy to illustrate the concepts of this profile. This example is not meant as an approved design, but ST authors will be expected to provide a diagram illustrating their key hierarchy in order to demonstrate that they meet the requirements of this profile. Please note if a BAF is selected in FIA_UAU.5.1, the BAF shall be illustrated in the key hierarchy diagram, to include a description of when and how the BAF is used to release keys. If "hybrid" is selected in FIA_UAU.5.1, meaning that a PIN or password must be used in conjunction with the BAF this interaction shall be included.<htm:br/>

                The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of SP800-56A
                Revision 3 key aestablishment schemes using the following Function and Validity
                tests. These validation tests for each key agreement scheme verify that a TOE has
                implemented the components of the key agreement scheme according to the
                specifications in the Recommendation. These components include the calculation of
                the DLC primitives (the shared secret value Z) and the calculation of the derived
                keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function (KDF). If key confirmation is
                supported, the evaluator shall also verify that the components of key confirmation
                have been implemented correctly, using the test procedures described below. This
                includes the parsing of the DKM, the generation of MACdata and the calculation of
                MACtag. <htm:br/><htm:br/>

                <htm:br/><htm:br/> The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement
                the key agreement schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall
                generate or obtain test vectors from a known good implementation of the TOE
                supported schemes. For each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role
                combination, KDF type, and, if supported, key confirmation role- key confirmation
                type combination, the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. The data set
                consists of one set of domain parameter values (FFC) or the NIST approved curve
                (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending
                on the scheme being tested. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The evaluator shall obtain the DKM,
                the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static and/or ephemeral), the MAC tag(s), and
                any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other Information field OI and TOE id
                fields. <htm:br/><htm:br/> If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A
                Revision 3, the evaluator shall obtain only the public keys and the hashed value of
                the shared secret. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The evaluator shall verify the correctness of
                the TSF’s implementation of a given scheme by using a known good implementation to
                calculate the shared secret value, derive the keying material DKM, and compare
                hashes or MAC tags generated from these values.<htm:br/><htm:br/> If key
                confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each implemented
                approved MAC algorithm. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
                <htm:i><htm:b>Validity Test</htm:b></htm:i>
                <htm:br/><htm:br/> The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize
                another party’s valid and invalid key agreement results with or without key
                confirmation. To conduct this test, the evaluator shall obtain a list of the
                supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A Revision 3 key
                agreement implementation to determine which errors the TOE should be able to
                recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24 (FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors
                consisting of data sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves,
                the evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s public/private key pairs, MACTag, and any
                inputs used in the KDF, such as the other info and TOE id fields. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
                The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE
                recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being
                incorrect: the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the
                data to be MACed, or the generated MACTag. If the TOE contains the full or partial
                (only ECC) public key validation, the evaluator will also individually inject errors
                in both parties’ static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the
                TOE’s static private key to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key
                validation function and/or the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At
                least two of the test vectors shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in
                valid key agreement results (they should pass). <htm:br/><htm:br/> The TOE shall use
                these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme using the
                corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results with the
                results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects these
                errors. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
                <htm:h3>SP800-56B Key Establishment Schemes</htm:h3> The evaluator shall verify that
                the TSS describes whether the TOE acts as a sender, a recipient, or both for
                RSA-based key establishment schemes. <htm:br/><htm:br/> If the TOE acts as a sender,
                the following evaluation activity shall be performed to ensure the proper operation
                of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based key establishment scheme: <htm:br/>
                To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a
                known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
                supported key establishment scheme and its options (with or without key confirmation
                if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key confirmation
                is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is
                supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test vector
                shall include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any additional
                input parameters if applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key confirmation is
                incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the evaluator
                shall perform a key establishment encryption operation on the TOE with the same
                inputs (in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the test shall use the
                MacKey from the test vector instead of the randomly generated MacKey used in normal
                operation) and ensure that the outputted ciphertext is equivalent to the ciphertext
                in the test vector. <htm:br/><htm:br/> If the TOE acts as a receiver, the following
                evaluation activities shall be performed to ensure the proper operation of every TOE
                supported combination of RSA-based key establishment scheme: <htm:br/> To conduct
                this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors FCS_CKM.2.1/LOCKED from a
                known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
                supported key establishment scheme and its options (with our without key
                confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key
                confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if
                KTS-OAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test
                vector shall include the RSA private key, the plaintext keying material (KeyData),
                any additional input parameters if applicable, the MacTag in cases where key
                confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector,
                the evaluator shall perform the key establishment decryption operation on the TOE
                and ensure that the outputted plaintext keying material (KeyData) is equivalent to
                the plaintext keying material in the test vector. In cases where key confirmation is
                incorporated, the evaluator shall perform the key confirmation steps and ensure that
                the outputted MacTag is equivalent to the MacTag in the test vector.
                <htm:br/><htm:br/> The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the TOE
                handles decryption errors. In accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-56B, the
                TOE must not reveal the particular error that occurred, either through the contents
                of any outputted or logged error message or through timing variations. If KTS-OAEP
                is supported, the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext values that
                trigger each of the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special
                Publication 800-56B section 7.2.2.3, ensure that each decryption attempt results in
                an error, and ensure that any outputted or logged error message is identical for
                each. If KTS-KEMKWS is supported, the evaluator shall create separate contrived
                ciphertext values that trigger each of the three decryption error checks described
                in NIST Special Publication 800-56B section 7.2.3.3, ensure that each decryption

              <Tests> The test for SP800-56A Revision 3 and SP800-56B key establishment schemes is
                performed in association with FCS_CKM.2/UNLOCKED. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
                <htm:b>Curve25519 Key Establishment Schemes</htm:b><htm:br/><htm:br/> The evaluator
                shall verify a TOE's implementation of the key agreement scheme using the following
                Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for each key agreement scheme
                verify that a TOE has implemented the components of the key agreement scheme
                according to the specification. These components include the calculation of the
                shared secret K and the hash of K. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
                <htm:b>Function Test</htm:b><htm:br/><htm:br/> The Function test verifies the
                ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement schemes correctly. To conduct this
                test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known good
                implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each supported key agreement role
                and hash function combination, the tester shall generate 10 sets of public keys.
                These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being tested.
                <htm:br/><htm:br/> The evaluator shall obtain the shared secret value K, and the
                hash of K.<htm:br/><htm:br/> The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s
                implementation of a given scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate
                the shared secret value K and compare the hash generated from this value. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
                <htm:b> Validity Test</htm:b><htm:br/><htm:br/> The Validity test verifies the
                ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid and invalid key agreement
                results. To conduct this test, the evaluator generates a set of 30 test vectors
                consisting of data sets including the evaluator’s public keys and the TOE’s
                public/private key pairs. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The evaluator shall inject an error in
                some of the test vectors to test that the TOE recognizes invalid key agreement
                results caused by the following fields being incorrect: the shared secret value K or
                the hash of K. At least two of the test vectors shall remain unmodified and
                therefore should result in valid key agreement results (they should pass).
                <htm:br/><htm:br/> The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key
                agreement scheme using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the
                TOE’s results with the results using a known good implementation verifying that the
                TOE detects these errors. <htm:br/><htm:br/>

              If a BAF is selected in FIA_UAU.5.1 the enrollment or authentication templates are not
              subject to this requirement, since templates are not suitable for deriving keying
              material. However, source biometric data (i.e. fingerprint image or friction ridge
              pattern), the features an algorithm uses to perform biometric authentication for
              enrollment or verification (e.g. location of minutia), threshold values used in making

            <note role="application">Per NIST SP 800-131A, SHA-1 for generating digital signatures
              is no longer allowed, and SHA-1 for verification of digital signatures is strongly
              discouraged as there may be risk in accepting these signatures. It is expected that
              vendors will implement SHA-2 algorithms in accordance with SP
              800-131A.<htm:br/><htm:br/> SHA-1 is currently required in order to comply with the
              WLAN Client Extended Package. Vendors are strongly encouraged to implement updated
              protocols that support the SHA-2 family; until updated protocols are supported, this
              PP allows support for SHA-1 implementations in compliance with SP
              800-131A.<htm:br/><htm:br/> The intent of this requirement is to specify the hashing
              function. The hash selection must support the message digest size selection. The hash
              selection should be consistent with the overall strength of the algorithm used (for
              example, SHA 256 for 128-bit keys). <htm:br/><htm:br/> The TSF hashing functions can
              be implemented in one of two modes. The first mode is the byte­oriented mode. In this
              mode the TSF only hashes messages that are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e.
              the length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is
              the bit­oriented mode. In this mode the TSF hashes messages of arbitrary length. The
              TSF may implement either bit-oriented or byte-oriented; both implementations are not
              required. </note>
            <aactivity>
              <TSS> The evaluator shall check that the association of the hash function with other
                TSF cryptographic functions (for example, the digital signature verification
                function) is documented in the TSS. The evalutator shall check that the TSS
                indicates if the hashing function is implemented in bit-oriented and/or

              author selects the appropriate number of bits of entropy that corresponds to the
              greatest security strength of the algorithms included in the ST. Security strength is
              defined in Tables 2 and 3 of NIST SP 800-57A. For example, if the implementation
              includes 2048-bit RSA (security strength of 112 bits), AES 128 (security strength 128
              bits), and HMAC-SHA-256 (security strength 256 bits), then the ST author would select
              256 bits. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The ST author may select either software or hardware
              noise sources. A hardware noise source is a component that produces data that cannot
              be explained by a deterministic rule, due to its physical nature. In other words, a
              hardware based noise source generates sequences of random numbers from a physical
              process that cannot be predicted. For example, a sampled ring oscillator consists of
              an odd number of inverter gates chained into a loop, with an electrical pulse
              traveling from inverter to inverter around the loop. The inverters are not clocked, so
              the precise time required for a complete circuit around the loop varies slightly as
              various physical effects modify the small delay time at each inverter on the line to
              the next inverter. This variance results in an approximate natural frequency that
              contains drift and jitter over time. The output of the ring oscillator consists of the
              oscillating binary value sampled at a constant rate from one of the inverters – a rate
              that is significantly slower than the oscillator’s natural frequency. </note>

              For each of the listed FCS components in the bulleted list, the intent is that the TOE will make available all algorithms specified for that component in the ST. For example, if for FCS_COP.1/HASH the ST author selects SHA-256, then the TOE would have to make available an interface to perform SHA-1 (the "mandatory" portion of FCS_COP.1/HASH) and SHA-256 (the "selected" portion of FCS_COP.1/HASH).<htm:br/><htm:br/> 
              The exception is for FCS_COP.1/ENCRYPT. The TOE is not required to make available AES_CCMP, AES_XTS, AES_GCMP-256, or AES_CCMP_256 even though they may be implemented to perform TSF-related functions. It is acceptable for the platform to not provide AES Key Wrap (KW) and AES Key Wrap with Padding (KWP) to applications even if selected in FCS_COP.1/ENCRYPT. <!-- NIAP: I do not want to remove Key Wrap from selection, but I am basically negating the SFR in the app note.  --> However, the ST author is expected to select AES-GCM and/or AES-CCM if it is selected in the ST for the FCS_COP.1/ENCRYPT component.

	    A subset of the User Data Protection focuses on protecting Data-At-Rest, namely FDP_DAR_EXT.1 and FDP_DAR_EXT.2.
            Three levels of data-at-rest protection are addressed: TSF data, Protected Data (and keys), and sensitive data.
	    <xref to="datalevels"/> addresses the level of protection required for each level of data-at-rest.

          <htm:br/> 
          All keys, protected data, and sensitive data must ultimately be protected by the REK. Sensitive data must be protected by the password in addition to the REK. In particular, <xref to="Keys"/> has KEKs protected according to these requirements: DEK_1 would be appropriate for sensitive data, DEK_2 would not be appropriate for sensitive data, K_1 is not considered a sensitive key, and K_2 is considered a sensitive key. <htm:br/><htm:br/> 
          These requirements include a capability for encrypting sensitive data received while in the locked state, which may be considered a separate sub-category of sensitive data. This capability may be met by a key transport scheme (RSA) by using a public key to encrypt the DEK while protecting the corresponding private key with a password-derived or biometric-unlocked KEK. <htm:br/><htm:br/> 
          This capability may also be met by a key agreement scheme. To do so, the device generates a device-wide sensitive data asymmetric pair (the private key of which is protected by a password-derived or biometric-unlocked KEK) and an asymmetric pair for the received sensitive data to be stored. In order to store the sensitive data, the device-wide public key and data private key are used to generate a shared secret, which can be used as a KEK or a DEK. The data private key and shared secret are cleared after the data is encrypted and the data public key stored. Thus, no key material is available in the locked state to decrypt the newly stored data. Upon unlock, the device-wide private key is decrypted and is used with each data public key to regenerate the shared secret and decrypt the stored data.
	  <xref to="KeysLocked"/>, below, illustrates this scheme. <htm:br/><htm:br/>

                    1: The evaluator shall enable a Wi-Fi configuration as described in the AGD
                    guidance (as required by FTP_ITC_EXT.1). The evaluator shall use a packet
                    sniffing tool between the wireless access point and an Internet-connected
                    network. The evaluator shall turn on the sniffing tool and perform actions with
                    the device such as navigating to websites, using provided applications, and
                    accessing other Internet resources. The evaluator shall verify that the sniffing
                    tool captures the traffic generated by these actions, turn off the sniffing
                    tool, and save the session data. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Step 2: The evaluator shall
                    configure an IPsec VPN client that supports the routing specified in this
                    requirement, and if necessary, configure the device to perform the routing
                    specified as described in the AGD guidance. The evaluator shall turn on the
                    sniffing tool, establish the VPN connection, and perform the same actions with
                    the device as performed in the first step. The evaluator shall verify that the
                    sniffing tool captures traffic generated by these actions, turn off the sniffing
                    tool, and save the session data. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Step 3: The evaluator shall
                    examine the traffic from both step one and step two to verify that all Data
                    Plane traffic is encapsulated by IPsec. The evaluator shall examine the Security
                    Parameter Index (SPI) value present in the encapsulated packets captured in Step
                    two from the TOE to the Gateway and shall verify this value is the same for all
                    actions used to generate traffic through the VPN. Note that it is expected that
                    the SPI value for packets from the Gateway to the TOE is different than the SPI
                    value for packets from the TOE to the Gateway. The evaluator shall be aware that
                    IP traffic on the cellular baseband outside of the IPsec tunnel may be emanating
                    from the baseband processor and shall verify with the manufacturer that any
                    identified traffic is not emanating from the application processor.
                    <htm:br/><htm:br/> Step 4: The evaluator shall perform an ICMP echo from the TOE
                    to the IP address of another device on the local wireless network and shall
                    verify that no packets are sent using the sniffing tool. The evaluator shall
                    attempt to send packets to the TOE outside the VPN tunnel (i.e. not through the
                    VPN gateway), including from the local wireless network, and shall verify that
                    the TOE discards them. </test>

              in meeting FIA_BMG_EXT.1.2. More generally, depending on the number of authentication
              attempts allowed for the BAF, the claimed FAR must be strong (or equivalently, low)

              False Accept Rate (SAFAR) is defined by the combination of individual error rates for
              each authentication factor and attempts used for access to a single session on the
              device. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Accessing a single session may involve a single
              authentication factor, in which case the SAFAR for a single attempt will be equal to
              the false accept rate (FAR) of that authentication factor and the SAFAR for n attempts
              will be $1-\left(1-FAR\right)^n$, assuming independence. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Accessing
              a single session on the device may involve the ability to use multiple authentication
              factors. It may be the case that only one authentication factor is needed to access a
              single session on the device (i.e. both a password and a BAF can be used, but only one
              is needed) or that both authentication factors are needed to access a single session
              on the device (i.e. both the BAF and a PIN must be entered). The full equations for
              calculating the SAFAR can be found in <xref to="biometric3"/>. A fully
              worked-out example that applies the equations in <xref to="biometric3"/> for
              calculating the SAFAR can be found in <xref to="biometric4"/>.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/> The worst-case scenario must be used to calculate the SAFAR. Thus
              the authentication factor with the highest FAR must be used for the maximum number of
              authentication attempts allowed for that factor. If any authentication attempts
              remain, then the authentication factor with the second highest FAR is used for the
              maximum number of authentication attempts allowed for that factor and so on. For
              example, the TOE supports a password and a BAF, the FAR for the BAF is higher than the
              FAR for the password and each authentication factor utilizes a shared counter per
              FIA_AFL_EXT.1. Then the worst-case scenario is the BAF is utilized for the maximum
              number of authentication attempts allowed for the BAF. For any remaining
              authentication attempts allowed the password is utilized. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Another
              example is the TOE supports a password and two BAFs, where the BAFs have different
              FARs, with both FARs being higher than the password FAR. Then the worst-case scenario
              is that the BAF with the highest FAR is used for the maximum number of authentication
              attempts allowed for that BAF, followed by the second BAF if any authentication
              attempts are allowed for that BAF. If any authentication attempts remain, then the
              password is utilized for those attempts. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The 1% margin is included
              for cases where a BAF is not a critical authentication factor and thus both BAF and
              password can be used in a session without exceeding the declared SAFAR.

              strength must be selected.<htm:br/><htm:br/> Because Presentation Attack Detection
              (PAD) is an open-ended problem much like vulnerability testing, it is neither
              cost-effective nor feasible to create a complete list of attack vectors and perform
              testing on all of them during the timeframe for CC evaluations. Such a list would be
              ever-changing, and unlike code vulnerabilities (i.e. CVEs), the equipment, skill,
              time, and cost required to test highly sophisticated attacks is highly infeasible for

              a photograph of a fingerprint or facial and submitting it to the sensor, among other
              examples. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Intermediate (or moderate <xref to="IBPC"/>) attacks
              can include, but are not limited to, creating a foam finger to thwart fingerprint
              detection and using a higher quality playback device to thwart liveness detection.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/> Advanced (including high and beyond high <xref to="IBPC"/>)
              attacks can include, but are not limited to, creating a synthetic hand with the given
              fingerprint using an expensive 3D-printer and forcing someone to reveal one’s
              credentials through coercion or threats that may cause harm (where detection of duress

            <note role="application">FIA_X509_EXT.1.1 lists the rules for validating certificates. The ST author must select whether revocation status is verified using OCSP or CRLs. OCSP stapling and OCSP multi-stapling only support TLS server certificate validation. If other certificate types are validated, either OCSP or CRL should be claimed. The WLAN Client EP to which a MDF TOE must also conform requires that certificates are used for EAP-TLS; this use requires that the extendedKeyUsage rules are verified. Certificates may optionally be used for trusted updates of system software and applications (FPT_TUD_EXT.2) and for integrity verification (FPT_TST_EXT.2(1)) and, if implemented, must be validated to contain the Code Signing purpose extendedKeyUsage.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
              While FIA_X509_EXT.1.1 requires that the TOE perform certain checks on the certificate presented by a TLS server, there are corresponding checks that the authentication server will have to perform on the certificate presented by the client; namely that the extendedKeyUsage field of the client certificate includes “Client Authentication” and that the key agreement bit (for the Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites) or the key encipherment bit (for RSA ciphersuites) be set. Certificates obtained for use by the TOE will have to conform to these requirements in order to be used in the enterprise. This check is required to support EAP-TLS for the WLAN Client EP.</note>

              <xref to="fmt_smf"/> compares the management functions required by this
              Protection Profile. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The first column lists the management functions
              identified in the PP. <htm:br/><htm:br/> In the following columns: <htm:ul>
                <htm:li>‘M’ means Mandatory</htm:li>
                <htm:li>‘O’ means Optional/Objective</htm:li>
                <htm:li>'-' means that no value (M or O) can be assigned</htm:li>
              </htm:ul>
              <htm:br/><htm:br/> The second column (FMT_SMF_EXT.1) indicates whether the function is
              to be implemented. The ST author should select which Optional functions are
              implemented. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The third column (FMT_MOF_EXT.1.1) indicates functions
              that are to be restricted to the user (i.e. not available to the administrator).
              <htm:br/><htm:br/> The fourth column (Administrator) indicates functions that are
              available to the administrator. The functions restricted to the user (column 3) cannot
              also be available to the administrator. Functions available to the administrator can
              still be available to the user, as long as the function is not restricted to the
              administrator (column 5). Thus, if the TOE must offer these functions to the
              administrator to perform the fourth column must be selected. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The
              fifth column (FMT_MOF_EXT.1.2) indicates whether the function is to be restricted to
              the administrator when the device is enrolled and the administrator applies the
              indicated policy. If the function is restricted to the administrator the function is
              not available to the user. This does not prevent the user from modifying a setting to
              make the function stricter, but the user cannot undo the configuration enforced by the
              administrator. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The ST author may use a table in the ST, listing
              only those functions that are implemented. For functions that are mandatory, any
              sub-functions not in a selection are also mandatory and any assignments must contain
              at least one assigned value. For functions that are optional and contain an assignment
              or selection, at least one value must be assigned/selected to be included in the ST.
              For non-selectable sub-functions in an optional function, all sub-functions must be
              implemented in order for the function to be included. For functions with a "per-app
              basis" sub function and an assignment, the ST author must indicate which assigned
              features are manageable on a per-app basis and which are not by iterating the row. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              <htm:b>Function-specific Application Notes:</htm:b><htm:br/><htm:br/> For functions
                <xref to="vpn"/>, <xref to="audioVisual"/> and <xref to="location"
              />, the function must be implemented on a device-wide basis but may also be
              implemented on a per-app basis or on a per-group of applications basis in which the
              configuration includes the list of applications or groups of applications to which the
              enable/disable applies. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Function <xref to="vpn"/> addresses
              enabling and disabling the IPsec VPN only. The configuration of the VPN Client itself
              (with information such as VPN Gateway, certificates, and algorithms) is addressed by
              the PP-Module for VPN Client. The administrator options should only be listed if the
              administrator can remotely enable/disable the VPN connection. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              Function <xref to="vpn"/> optionally allows the VPN to be configured per-app or
              per-groups of apps. If this configuration is selected, it does not void FDP_IFC_EXT.1.
              Instead FDP_IFC_EXT.1 is applied to the application or group of applications the VPN
              is applied to. In other words, all traffic destined for the VPN-enabled application or
              group of applications, must travel through the VPN, but traffic not destined for that
              application or group of applications can travel outside the VPN. When the VPN is
              configured across the device FDP_IFC_EXT.1 applies to all traffic and the VPN must not
              split tunnel. <htm:br/><htm:br/> 
              The assignment in function <xref to="radios"/>
              consists of all radios present on the TSF, such as Wi-Fi, cellular, NFC,
              Bluetooth BR/EDR, and Bluetooth LE, which can be enabled and disabled. In the future,
              if both Bluetooth BR/EDR and Bluetooth LE are supported, they will be required to be
              enabled and disabled separately. Disablement of the cellular radio does not imply that
              the radio may not be enabled in order to place emergency phone calls; however, it is
              not expected that a device in "airplane mode", where all radios are disabled, will
              automatically (without authorization) turn on the cellular radio to place emergency
              calls. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The assignment in function <xref to="audioVisual"/>
              consists of at least one audio and/or visual device, such as camera and microphone,
              which can be enabled and disabled by either the user or administrator. Disablement of
              the microphone does not imply that the microphone may not be enabled in order to place
              emergency phone calls. If certain devices are able to be restricted to the enterprise
              (either device-wide, per-app or per-group of applications) and others are able to be
              restricted to users, then this function should be iterated in the table with the
              appropriate table entries. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Regarding functions <xref
                to="radios"/> and <xref to="audioVisual"/>, disablement of a particular
              radio or audio/visual device must be effective as soon as the TOE has power.
              Disablement must also apply when the TOE is booted into auxiliary boot modes, for
              example, associated with updates or backup. If the TOE supports states in which
              security management policy is inaccessible, for example, due to data-at-rest
              protection, it is acceptable to meet this requirement by ensuring that these devices
              are disabled by default while in these states. That these devices are disabled during
              auxiliary boot modes does not imply that the device (particularly the cellular radio)
              may not be enabled in order to perform emergency phone calls. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Wipe
              of the TSF (function <xref to="wipe"/>) is performed according to FCS_CKM_EXT.5.
              Protected data is all non-TSF data, including all user or enterprise data. Some or all
              of this data may be considered sensitive data as well. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The
              selection in function <xref to="appInstallRules"/> allows the ST author to
              select which mechanisms are available to the administrator through the MDM Agent to
              restrict the applications which the user may install. The ST author must state if
              application allowlist is applied device-wide or if it can be specified to apply to
              either the Enterprise and/or Personal applications. <htm:ul>
                <htm:li>If the administrator can restrict the sources from which applications can be
                  installed, the ST author selects option a. </htm:li>
                <htm:li>If the administrator can specify a allowlist of allowed applications, the ST
                  author selects option b. The ST author should list any application characteristics
                  (e.g. name, version, or developer) based on which the allowlist can be
                  formed.</htm:li>
                <htm:li>If the administrator can prevent the user from installing additional
                  applications, the ST author selects c. </htm:li>
              </htm:ul>
              <htm:br/>In the future, function <xref to="certWipe"/> may require
              destruction or disabling of any default trusted CA certificates, excepting those CA
              certificates necessary for continued operation of the TSF, such as the developer’s
              certificate. At this time, the ST author must indicate in the assignment whether
              pre-installed or any other category of X.509v3 certificates may be removed from the
              Trust Anchor Database. <htm:br/><htm:br/> 
              For function <xref to="enroll"/>, the
              enrollment function may be installing an MDM agent and includes the policies to be
              applied to the device. It is acceptable for the user approval notice to require the
              user to intentionally opt to view the policies (for example, by "tapping" on a "View"
              icon) rather than listing the policies in full in the notice. <htm:br/><htm:br/> For
              function <xref to="update"/>, the administrator capability to update the system
              software may be limited to causing a prompt to the user to update rather than the
              ability to initiate the update itself. As the administrator is likely to be acting
              remotely, he/she would be unaware of inopportune situations, such as low power, which
              may cause the update to fail and the device to become inoperable. The user can refuse
              to accept the update in such situations. It is expected that system architects will be
              cognizant of this limitation and will enforce network access controls in order to
              enforce enterprise-critical updates. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Function <xref
                to="appInstall"/> addresses both installation and update. This protection profile
              does not distinguish between installation and update of applications because mobile
              devices typically completely overwrite the previous installation with a new
              installation during an application update. <htm:br/><htm:br/> For function <xref
                to="entAppRemove"/>, "Enterprise applications" are those applications that belong
              to the Enterprise application group. Applications installed by the enterprise
              administrator (including automatic installation by the administrator after being
              requested by the user from a catalog of enterprise applications) are by default placed
              in the Enterprise application group unless an exception has been made in function
                <xref to="appGroups"/> of FMT_SMF_EXT.1.1. <htm:br/><htm:br/> If the display
              of notifications in the locked state is supported, the configuration of these
              notifications (function <xref to="notifications"/>) must be included in the
              selection. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Function <xref to="dar"/> must be included in the
              selection if data-at-rest protection is not natively enabled. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              Function <xref to="rmediaDar"/> is implicitly met if the TSF does not support
              removable media. <htm:br/><htm:br/> 
              For function <xref to="location"/>, location
              services include location information gathered from GPS, cellular, and Wi-Fi.
              <htm:br/><htm:br/> Function <xref to="authFactors"/> is implicitly met if the
              TOE does not contain a BAF. This selection must correspond with the selection made in

              actions that TOE may provide (perhaps via APIs) to the administrator (perhaps via an MDM
              agent) that may be performed upon un-enrollment. "Enterprise applications" refers to
              applications that are in the Enterprise application group. "Enterprise resource data"
              refers to all stored Enterprise data and the separate resources that are available to
              the Enterprise application group, per FDP_ACF_EXT.2.1. If FDP_ACF_EXT.2.1 is included
              in the ST, then "remove all device-stored Enterprise resource data" must be selected,
              and is defined to be all resources selected in FDP_ACF_EXT.2.1. If FIA_UAU_EXT.4.1 is
              included in the ST, then "remove Enterprise secondary authentication data" must be
              selected. If FIA_UAU_EXT.4.1 is not included in the ST, then "remove Enterprise
              secondary authentication data" cannot be selected. Enterprise secondary authentication
              data only refers to any data stored on the TOE that is specifically used as part of a
              secondary authentication mechanism to authenticate access to Enterprise applications
              and shared resources. Material that is used for the TOE’s primary authentication
              mechanism or other purposes not related to authentication to or protection of
              Enterprise applications or shared resources should not be removed. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
              Protected data is all non-TSF data, including all user or enterprise data. Some or all
              of this data may be considered sensitive data as well. If "wipe of protected data" is
              selected it is assumed that the sensitive data is wiped as well. However, if "wipe of
              sensitive data" is selected, it does not imply that all non-TSF data (protected data)
              is wiped. If "wipe of protected data" or "wipe of sensitive data" is selected the wipe
              must be in accordance with FCS_CKM_EXT.5.1. Thus cryptographically wiping the device
              is an acceptable remediation action. </note>

        to="sobj"/> were constructed to address threats identified in <xref to="spd"/>.
      The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) in <xref to="sfr"/> are a formal
      instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP identifies the Security Assurance
      Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation
      applicable for the evaluation and performs independent testing.<htm:br/><htm:br/> This section
      lists the set of SARs from CC part 3 that are required in evaluations against this PP.
      Individual Evaluation Activities to be performed are specified both in <xref to="sfr"/>
      as well as in this section. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The general model for evaluation of TOEs
      against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows:<htm:br/><htm:br/> After the ST has
      been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF will obtain the
      TOE, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for the TOE. The ITSEF is
      expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) for the ASE
      and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Evaluation Activities contained within <xref
        to="sfr"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM evaluation
      requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the TOE. The Evaluation
      Activities that are captured in <xref to="sfr"/> also provide clarification as to what
      the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the TOE is compliant with the PP.

            directly invokable by TOE users, there is little point specifying that such interfaces
            be described in and of themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be
            possible. For this PP, the activities for this family should focus on understanding the

              the ST is covered. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the ST,
              the test plan provides a justification for not testing the platforms. This
              justification must address the differences between the tested platforms and the
              untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not affect the
              testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the differences
              have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in the ST are
              tested, then no rationale is necessary. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The test plan describes the
              composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is necessary beyond what

              either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This may include special
              test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not just an assertion)
              should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely affect the performance
              of the functionality by the TOE and its platform. This also includes the configuration
              of the cryptographic engine to be used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by

              being evaluated (IPsec, TLS/HTTPS, SSH). <htm:br/><htm:br/> The test plan identifies
              high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be followed to achieve
              those objectives. These procedures include expected results. The test report (which
              could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details the activities that took
              place when the test procedures were executed, and includes the actual results of the

              a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of the test, the report would

    The documentation of the

    documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design description, entropy
    justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation is not required to
    be part of the TSS. 
    <section id="description" title="Design Description">
      Documentation shall
      include the design of the entropy source as a whole, including the interaction of all entropy
      source components. It will describe the operation of the entropy source to include how it
      works, how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the
      entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source
      design indicating where the random comes from, where it is passed next, any post-processing of
      the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how it is output from
      the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking) should also be
      described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> This design must also include a description of the content of the security
      boundary of the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an
      adversary outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate. <htm:br/><htm:br/> If
      implemented, the design description shall include a description of how third-party
      applications can add entropy to the RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between
      power-off and power-on shall be included. </section>
    <section id="justification" title="Entropy Justification"> 
      There should be a technical argument
      for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence in the
      entropy source exhibiting probabilistic behavior (an explanation of the probability
      distribution and justification for that distribution given the particular source is one way to
      describe this). This argument will include a description of the expected entropy rate and
      explain how you ensure that sufficient entropy is going into the TOE randomizer seeding
      process. This discussion will be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be
      relied upon to produce bits with entropy. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The entropy justification shall
      not include any data added from any third-party application or from any state saving between
      restarts. </section>
    <section id="conditions" title="Operating Conditions"> 
      Documentation will also include the range
      of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. It
      will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the
      entropy source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall
      describe the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction or become
      inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included. </section>
    <section id="testing" title="Health Testing"> 
      More specifically, all entropy source health tests
      and their rationale will be documented. This will include a description of the health tests,
      the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at startup,
      continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, and rationale
      indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in
      the entropy source.</section>

  <appendix id="biometric" title="Biometric Derivation and Examples">
    <section id="biometric1" title="Experimental Setups And Error Bars In Testing FAR And FRR">
      <section id="sub1" title="Introduction"> For the purposes of this PP, FIA_BMG_EXT.1 
		requires testing for FAR, FRR and SAFAR if a BAF is included in
        the TOE. In this version of the PP it is expected that the vendor will provide evidence to
        the evaluator of the testing completed to support the claimed FAR and FRR. This Appendix
        provides a guide to how this testing could be done and to what error bars are expected when
        the Rule of 3 is applied. This guide should be treated as a reference and not as a NIAP
        mandate, requirement, or set of mandates or requirements. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      </section>
      <section id="sub2" title="Testing environment that could meet FIA_BMG_EXT.1.1"> In
        performing tests for FAR and FRR, ISO/IEC 19795-1 recommends that vendors or testing labs
        use the largest test population that can be reasonably managed. Generally, testing
        environments for mobile devices are based upon individual devices with their own local
        authentication templates/profiles where the submitted biometric samples are destroyed after
        submission. It is infeasible to meet the given timeframe for CC evaluations of mobile
        devices if offline testing is not supported. Either online or offline testing is acceptable.
        The number of test subjects needed to support a claimed FAR and FRR, will depend on if
        online or offline testing is used due to how the subjects are compared. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
        If online testing is utilized, it is expected that the testing is conducted directly on the
        TOE. The legitimate user will enroll on the TOE and all test subjects will be compared to
        only the legitimate user. Thus if the target FAR is 1:100, at least 300 independent samples
        shall be used corresponding to 300 users and at least 300 independent trials are required in
        testing this FAR. It is acceptable that multiple TOEs, each with a different legitimate
        user, could be used to reduce the number of test subjects needed for online testing. With
        the assumption that the test subjects are compared against all legitimate users and no
        legitimate users are counted as test subjects, if <htm:i>N<htm:sub>D</htm:sub></htm:i>
        devices are used, the number of test subjects needed can be divided by
            <htm:i>N<htm:sub>D</htm:sub></htm:i>. <htm:br/><htm:br/> If offline testing is used, it
        is expected that the biometric system used for testing will not be in the evaluated
        configuration of the TOE to allow for a full cross-comparison, in which the biometric sample
        from the test subjects is compared with every non-self template. It is expected, that the
        biometric system used for testing will collect samples and generate templates exactly the
        same as the biometric system in the TOE. However, even though the comparison to determine if
        a valid sample is provided (i.e. matching algorithm) should remain the same, it is
        acceptable if the biometric system is modified to complete a full cross-comparison. Per
        ISO/IEC 19795, these comparisons will not be statistically independent, but this approach is
        statistically unbiased. Additionally, offline testing with a full cross-comparison greatly
        reduces the number of test subjects needed. If there are
          <htm:i>N<htm:sub>U</htm:sub></htm:i> users, the number of available individual independent
        comparisons will be <htm:i>N<htm:sub>U</htm:sub>*(N<htm:sub>U</htm:sub>-1)/2</htm:i>. Thus
        if the target FAR is 1:10000, only 246 test subjects are needed if offline testing of a full
        cross-comparison is used. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      </section>
      <section id="sub3" title="Deriving False Accept Rate"> To expedite approval while
        maintaining a statistically valid result, it is required for the vendor or independent lab
        to perform testing using <htm:i>three</htm:i> times the sample size, at a minimum, i.e. the
        "Rule of 3" for the number of trials. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Three times the sample size
        corresponds to 90% confidence and <htm:i>c</htm:i> = 0.95 (rounded, worst-case), where
          <htm:i>c</htm:i> is a percentage/fraction of the intended false error rate (either FAR or
        FRR) for which the error bar is calculated. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The parameters associated
        with the Rule of 3 are derived by treating a biometric test, consisting of many comparisons,
        as a series of Bernoulli trials. <htm:br/><htm:br/> As shown in the tables below, the error
        bar may be large if a higher false error rate is declared. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The table
        below assumes online testing using a single device, thus a single legitimate user. <htm:br/><htm:br/>

    <section id="biometric2" title="Derivation of the Rule of 3 (and similar rules, for completeness)"> 
      A biometric test
      can be treated as a series of Bernoulli trials for which a binomial distribution of the number
      of successes and failures is assumed. When calculating an error interval for which a binomial
      distribution is assumed, one confidence interval (denoted
        <htm:i>I<htm:sub>conf</htm:sub></htm:i>) that is widely used is the standard Wald interval,
      expressed in Equation (1) as: <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      $$\left(p-z_{α/2}&#x221a;\frac{p\left(1-p\right)}{n}\right)&#x2264;I_{conf}&#x2264;
      \left(p+z_{α/2}&#x221a;\frac{p\left(1-p\right)}{n}\right)\quad\quad(1)$$ 
      <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      where <htm:i>p = X/n</htm:i> is the sample proportion of successes (or error in this case),
          <htm:i>z<htm:sub>α/2</htm:sub></htm:i> is the 100(1 – α/2)th percentile of the standard
      normal distribution, and <htm:i>n</htm:i> is the number of trials. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Although
      intervals such as the Wilson, Agresti-Coull, and Jeffreys intervals are recommended by Brown
      et al., biometrics testing in practice rests on the derivation of the Rule of 30 based on the
      Wald distribution <xref to="Brown"/>. However, because of the large sample size, number
      of test subjects, and number of trials required for the Rule of 30, this PP mandates the Rule
      of 3 to make testing more feasible. <htm:br/><htm:br/> In simpler form, this refers to a
      confidence interval with error <htm:i>E</htm:i> expressed as: <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      $$E=z_{α/2}&#x221a;\frac{p\left(1-p\right)}{n}\quad\quad(2)$$ <htm:br/><htm:br/> Rearranging
      the equation to express the number of trials, <htm:i>n</htm:i>, in terms of error
        <htm:i>E</htm:i>, this expression becomes: <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      $$n=\left(\frac{z_{α/2}}{E}\right)^2p\left(1-p\right)\quad\quad(3)$$ <htm:br/><htm:br/> In
      practice, <htm:i>E</htm:i> is expressed as a proportion of the error probability as:
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> $$E = cp\quad\quad(4)$$ <htm:br/><htm:br/> Thus, <htm:i>n</htm:i> finally
      becomes: <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      $$n=\left(\frac{z_{α/2}}{c}\right)^2\frac{\left(1-p\right)}{p}\quad\quad(5)$$
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> For a 90% confidence interval, <htm:i>z<htm:sub>α/2</htm:sub></htm:i> =
      1.6449, while for a 95% confidence interval, <htm:i>z<htm:sub>α/2</htm:sub></htm:i> = 1.96.
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> Thus it is easy to see that for a 90% confidence interval with
        <htm:i>c</htm:i> = 0.95: <htm:br/><htm:br/> $$\left ( \frac{1.6449}{0.95}\right )^{2}= 2.998
      &#x2248; 3\quad\quad(6)$$ <htm:br/><htm:br/> which confirms the rule of 3 and completes our
      derivation. </section>
    <section id="biometric3" title="SAFAR Calculation Equations"> A number of equations can be used
      in calculating SAFAR. A fully-worked example that applies the equations below can be found in
        <xref to="biometric4"/>. <htm:br/><htm:br/> The SAFAR for a single authentication
      factor is calculated as $SAFAR=1-\left(1-FAR\right)^{attempts allowed}$. <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      Thus let <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>i</htm:sub></htm:i> be the SAFAR for the
          <htm:i>i<htm:sup>th</htm:sup></htm:i> authentication factor where
          <htm:i>n<htm:sub>i</htm:sub></htm:i> is the number of authentication attempts allowed for
      the given factor, treated individually as a separate authentication system, which can be
      expressed as <htm:br/><htm:br/> $$SAFAR_i=1-\left(1-FAR_i\right)^{ni},\quad\quad (1)$$
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> assuming each attempt is independent. <htm:br/><htm:br/> If multiple
      authentication factors are required (with all to pass), i.e. password plus biometric factor,
      the SAFAR for a single attempt will be the product of each individual factor’s false accept
      rate, assuming each attempt is independent. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Thus, for a hybrid combination
      of <htm:i>m</htm:i> PIN/password and biometric factors (denoted with index <htm:i>j</htm:i>)
      with <htm:i>n<htm:sub>i</htm:sub></htm:i> attempts allowed, treated collectively as an
      individual authentication factor in a separate authentication system, the SAFAR can be
      expressed as: <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      $$SAFAR_i=1-\left(1-&#x220f;^m_{j=1}FAR_j\right)^{ni},\quad\quad (2)$$ <htm:br/> assuming each
      attempt is independent. Because this is currently associated with a PIN/password and
      biometrics, <htm:i>m</htm:i> = 2 in this case. <htm:br/><htm:br/> When ordered, let
          <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>(k)</htm:sub></htm:i> be the SAFAR for the authentication factor with
      the largest SAFAR, and <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>(1)</htm:sub></htm:i> be the SAFAR for the
      authentication factor with the smallest SAFAR, i.e. <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>(1)</htm:sub></htm:i>
      ≤ <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>(s)</htm:sub></htm:i> ≤ … ≤
        <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>(k-1)</htm:sub></htm:i> ≤ <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>(k)</htm:sub></htm:i>.
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> As such, the following equations for SAFAR utilizing multiple factors
      follow (using the worst SAFARs): <htm:br/><htm:br/> If the user has a choice of multiple
      authentication factors with a choice of only one authentication factor in a given session
      (i.e. all authentication factors are considered critical and a user cannot switch between
      authentication factors), the overall SAFAR will be equal to
        <htm:i>SAFAR<htm:sub>(k)</htm:sub></htm:i>, assuming each attempt is independent.
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> If the user has a choice of multiple authentication factors and can choose
      to attempt authentication using more than one factor with success requiring any factor to pass
      and <htm:i>n<htm:sub>i</htm:sub></htm:i> attempts allowed per factor) for a given session, the
      SAFAR for <htm:i>k</htm:i> available authentication factors will be <htm:br/><htm:br/>
      $$SAFAR_{any}=1-&#x220f;^k_{i=1}\left(1-SAFAR_i\right)\quad\quad (3)$$ <htm:br/> assuming each
      attempt is independent. If there are <htm:i>critical factors</htm:i>, the highest SAFAR
      corresponding to the <htm:i>worst-case</htm:i> set of choices shall be reported.
      <htm:br/><htm:br/> If the user has the choice of a number of authentication factors from which
      the user must choose <htm:i>m</htm:i> factors, all of which must pass with <htm:i>n</htm:i>
      attempts per factor allowed, the SAFAR for a single combination of <htm:i>m</htm:i> factors
      will be <htm:br/><htm:br/> $$SAFAR_{m factors}=&#x220f;^m_{i=1}\left(SAFAR_i\right)\quad\quad
      (4)$$ <htm:br/><htm:br/> assuming each attempt is independent. If <htm:i>m &lt; k</htm:i>
      available factors, the worst-case of all $\left(^k_m\right)$ combinations of factors becomes
      the overall SAFAR. </section>

        </htm:li>
        <htm:li> If the user is only allowed to pick one factor, the overall SAFAR is that of the

        </htm:li>
        <htm:li> If the conditions are the same as in c) but with password as a critical factor, the

          either authentication factor is compromised, the same sample can then be used by the
          adversary for every authentication after, thus reducing the SAFAR for the system to that
          of the other authentication factor. <htm:br/><htm:br/>

        <htm:li> If password/PIN and fingerprint are now combined into a single hybrid factor, the

          <htm:br/> This is more secure than e) because not only are there less attempts overall
          before the maximum count is exceeded (10 instead of 20), the adversary would not know if a
          sample submitted for either factor results in authentication unless the presentation of

<!-- Trusted Channels/RF protocols
  
WLAN -> WLAN Client Module
    - WLAN (specifically 802.11-2012,  802.1X, EAP-TLS) is mandatory to be included in a MDF ST, FTP_ITC_EXT.1.1 mandates it 
        - TODO: Determine if this wording needs to change when WLAN Client is updated to module
    - Mapping to threat/objectives -> in WLAN Client Module
    - Audit -> in WLAN Client Module 

Bluetooth -> Bluetooth Module
    - Bluetooth is mandatory to be included in a MDF ST (if HW exists), FDP_UPC_EXT.1/BLUETOOTH mandates BR/EDR but LE is selecatable 
    - Mapping to threat/objectives -> in MDF
    - Audit -> in BT Module
    - Still trying to determine where the line is drawn for what is in module and what stays in MDF b/c some of the "BT" SFRs are actually done by the OS
    - Mapping between MDF v3.1 and BT module - spreadsheet
                       
TLS -> TLS Package
    - TLS is mandatory to be included in MDF ST, FDP_UPC_EXT.1/APPS and FTP_ITC_EXT.1.1 mandates it
    - Mapping to threat/objectives -> in MDF
    - Audit -> in MDF
   
DTLS -> TLS Package
   - DTLS is NOT mandatory, but selectable in FDP_UPC_EXT.1/APPS and FTP_ITC_EXT.1.1
   - Mapping to threat/objectives -> in MDF
   - Audit -> in MDF
   
   IPSec -> VPN Client Module
   - IPSec is NOT mandatory, but selectable in FDP_UPC_EXT.1/APPS, FTP_ITC_EXT.1.1 and FDP_IFC_EXT.1.1
   - Flow contol (i.e. don't allow a split tunnel) is mandatory for the platform to implement (whether it be the native VPN client and/or a 3rd party application)
   - Mapping to threat/objectives -> in VPN Client Module
   - Audit -> in VPN Client Module (but currently objective)

  HTTPS -> MDF (but really covered in TLS Package)
  - HTTPS is mandatory (SFRs in Section 5) b/c FDP_UPC_EXT.1/APPS mandates it, also selectable in FTP_ITC_EXT.1.1
      - HTTPS SFRs in MDF (FCS_HTTPS_EXT.1.2) requires "implement HTTPS using TLS as defined in the Package for Transport Layer Security." 
  - Mapping to threat/objectives -> in MDF
  - Audit -> in MDF
  - Cert ->
      - If peer cert is deemed invalid, allow override (FCS_HTTPS_EXT.1.3 and FMT function ctr-id: CertInvalid)
      - If peer cert validity cannot be determined, __________

<!-- Mapping to TLS Package: 
  
     MDF   Package (Client) 
     1.1 = 1.1 - need to mandate that a ciphersuite other than SHA1 is selected. - do this just like MDM (and turn blind eye to the fact that FCS_COP.1 still allows SHA1)
     1.2 = 1.2
     1.3 ~ 1.3 - need to mandate selection "with no exceptions"
     1.4 (man) = 2.1 (sel-based) - mandating mutual auth to be selected so 2.1 becomes mandatory
     2.1 = 5.1
     3.1 = 3.1
     3.2 (man) = 4.1 (sel-based) - okay with change
     3.3 (man) = 4.2 (sel-based) - okay with change
