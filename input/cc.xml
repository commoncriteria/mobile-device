        The IT market is, on the whole, made up of vendors offering a
        particular type of product/technology. Although there is some
        overlap, where a PC hardware vendor may also offer application
        software and/or operating systems or a chip manufacturer may
        also develop a dedicated operating system for their own
        chipset, it is often the case that an IT solution is
        implemented by a variety of vendors.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        There is sometimes a need for assurance in the combination
        (composition) of components in addition to the assurance of
        the individual components. Although there is cooperation
        between these vendors, in the dissemination of certain
        material required for the technical integration of the
        components, the agreements rarely stretch to the extent of
        providing detailed design information and development
        process/procedure evidence. This lack of information from the
        developer of a component on which another component relies
        means that the dependent component developer does not have
        access to the type of information necessary to perform an
        evaluation of both the dependent and base components at EAL2
        or above. Therefore, while an evaluation of the dependent
        component can still be performed at any assurance level, to
        compose components with assurance at EAL2 or above it is
        necessary to reuse the evaluation evidence and results of
        evaluations performed for the component developer.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        It is intended that the <xref id="aco" show="id"/> criteria
        are applicable in the situation where one IT entity is
        dependent on another for the provision of security
        services. The entity providing the services is termed the
        ``base component'', and that receiving the services is termed
        the ``dependent component''. This relationship may exist in a
        number of contexts. For example, an application (dependent
        component) may use services provided by an operating system
        (base component). Alternatively, the relationship may be
        peer-to-peer, in the sense of two linked applications, either
        running in a common operating system environment, or on
        separate hardware platforms. If there is a dominant peer
        providing the services to the minor peer, the dominant peer is
        considered to be the base component and the minor peer the
        dependent component. If the peers provide services to each
        other in a mutual manner, each peer will be considered to be
        the base component for the services offered and dependent
        component for the services required. This will require
        iterations of the <xref id="aco" show="id"/> components
        applying all requirements to each type of component
        peer.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        The criteria are also intended to be more broadly applicable,
        stepwise (where a composed TOE comprised of a dependent
        component and a base component itself becomes the base
        component of another composed TOE), in more complex
        relationships, but this may require further
        interpretation.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        It is still required for composed TOE evaluations that the
        individual components are evaluated independently, as the
        composition evaluation builds on the results of the individual
        component evaluations. The evaluation of the dependent
        component may still be in progress when the composed TOE
        evaluation commences.  However, the dependent component
        evaluation must complete before the composed TOE evaluation
        completes.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        The composed evaluation activities may take place at the same
        time as the dependent component evaluation. This is due to two
        factors:
        <list type="enumerated">
          <item>
            Economic/business drivers - the dependent component
            developer will either be sponsoring the composition
            evaluation activities or supporting these activities as
            the evaluation deliverables from the dependent component
            evaluation are required for composed evaluation
            activities.</item>
          <item>
            Technical drivers - the components consider whether the
            requisite assurance is provided by the base component
            (e.g. considering the changes to the base component since
            completion of the component evaluation) with the
            understanding that the dependent component has recently
            undergone (is undergoing) component evaluation and all
            evaluation deliverables associated with the evaluation are
            available. Therefore, there are no activities during
            composition requesting the dependent component evaluation
            activities to be re-verified.  Also, it is verified that
            the base component forms (one of) the test configurations
            for the testing of the dependent component during the
            dependent component evaluation, leaving <xref id="aco_ctt" show="id"/> to consider the base component in this
            configuration.</item></list></para>
      <para type="normal">
        The evaluation evidence from the evaluation of the dependent
        component is required input into the composed TOE evaluation
        activities.  The only evaluation material from the evaluation
        of the base component that is required as input into the
        composed TOE evaluation activities:
        <list type="enumerated">
          <item>
            Residual vulnerabilities in the base component, as
            reported during the base component evaluation. This is

        No other evaluation evidence from the base component
        activities should be required for the composed TOE evaluation,
        as the evaluation results from the component evaluation of the
        base component should be reused. Additional information about
        the base component may be required if the composed TOE TSF
        includes more of the base component than was considered to be
        TSF during component evaluation of the base component.</para>

      <para type="normal">
      The <xref id="aco_vul" show="id"/> components only consider

      that can be provided of how the base component provides the
      services on which the dependent component relies through
      application of the <xref id="aco_dev" show="id"/>
      activities. Therefore, the confidence arising from composed TOE
      evaluations using CAPs is limited to a level similar to that
      obtained from EAL4 component TOE evaluations.  Although
      assurance in the components that comprise the composed TOE may
      be higher than EAL4.</para>

          TSF-a needs those services that are provided by TSF-b ("A" is connected to "C"):
          this is straightforward: the details about "C" are in the FSP for component-b.

          the component-b.

            Non-TSF-a needs those services that are provided by TSF-b

            Non-TSF-a needs those services that are provided by

            no claims about I&amp;A (has no <xref id="fia" show="id"/>

        is dictated by the assurance components used in the

        its Assumptions subclause and state security objectives for the

        instantiate those objectives for the environment in terms of
        SFRs for the OS. However, there will be no specification for
        the OS that mirrors the detail in the functional

      A security architecture is a set of properties that the TSF

      these properties, as well as discussion on contents of a
      security architecture description.</para>
      <para type="normal">
      The remainder of this subclause first explains these properties,

      describe how the TSF exhibits those properties.</para> <subclause title="Security architecture properties" id="arc_props">
        <para type="normal">
          <italic>Self-protection</italic> refers to the ability of
          the TSF to protect itself from manipulation from external
          entities that may result in changes to the TSF. Without these
          properties, the TSF might be disabled from performing its
          security services.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          It is oftentimes the case that a TOE uses services or
          resources supplied by other IT entities in order to perform
          its functions (e.g. an application that relies upon its
          underlying operating system). In these cases, the TSF does
          not protect itself entirely on its own, because it depends
          on the other IT entities to protect the services it
          uses.</para>
        <para type="normal"><italic>Domain separation</italic> is a property whereby the TSF
      creates separate <italic>security domains</italic> for each
      untrusted active entity to operate on its resources, and then
      keeps those domains separated from one another so that no entity
      can run in the domain of any other. For example, an operating
      system TOE supplies a domain (address space, per-process
      environment variables) for each process associated with
      untrusted entities.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          For some TOEs such domains do not exist because all of the
          actions of the untrusted entities are brokered by the TSF. A
          packet-filter firewall is an example of such a TOE, where
          there are no untrusted entity domains; there are only data
          structures maintained by the TSF. The existence of domains,
          then, is dependant upon 1) the type of TOE and 2) the SFRs
          levied on the TOE. In the cases where the TOE does provide
          domains for untrusted entities, this family requires that
          those domains are isolated from one another such that
          untrusted entities in one domain are prevented from
          tampering (affecting without brokering by the TSF) from
          another untrusted entity's domain.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          <italic>Non-bypassability</italic> is a property that the
          security functionality of the TSF (as specified by the SFRs)
          is always invoked and cannot be circumvented when
          appropriate for that specific mechanism. For example, if
          access control to files is specified as a capability of the
          TSF via an SFR, there must be no interfaces through which
          files can be accessed without invoking the TSF's access
          control mechanism (an interface through which a raw disk
          access takes place might be an example of such an
          interface).</para>
        <para type="normal">
          As is the case with self-protection, the very nature of some
          TOEs might depend upon their environments to play a role in
          non-bypassability of the TSF. For example, a security
          application TOE requires that it be invoked by the
          underlying operating system. Similarly, a firewall depends
          upon the fact that there are no direct connections between
          the internal and external networks and that all traffic
          between them must go through the firewall.</para>

          The security architecture description explains how the
          properties described above are exhibited by the TSF.  It
          describes how domains are defined and how the TSF keeps them
          separate. It describes what prevents untrusted processes
          from getting to the TSF and modifying it. It describes what
          ensures that all resources under the TSF's control are
          adequately protected and that all actions related to the
          SFRs are mediated by the TSF. It explains any role the
          environment plays in any of these (e.g. presuming it gets
          correctly invoked by its underlying environment, how are its
          security functions invoked?).</para>
        <para type="normal">
      The security architecture description presents the TSF's
      properties of self-protection, domain separation, and
      non-bypassability in terms of the decomposition descriptions.
      The level of this description is commensurate with the TSF
      description required by the <xref id="adv_fsp" show="id"/>,
      <xref id="adv_tds" show="id"/> and <xref id="adv_imp" show="id"/> requirements that are being claimed. For example, if
      <xref id="adv_fsp" show="id"/> is the only TSF description
      available, it would be difficult to provide any meaningful
      security architecture description because none of the details of
      any internal workings of the TSF would be available.</para>
        <para type="normal">
      However, if the TOE design were also available, even at the most
      basic level (<xref id="adv_tds.1" show="id"/>), there would be
      some information available concerning the subsystems that make
      up the TSF, and there would be a description of how they work to
      implement self-protection, domain separation, and
      non-bypassability. For example, perhaps all user interaction
      with the TOE is constrained through a process that acts on that
      user's behalf, adopting all of the user's security attributes;
      the security architecture description would describe how such a
      process comes into being, how the process's behaviour is
      constrained by the TSF (so it cannot corrupt the TSF), how all
      actions of that process are mediated by the TSF (thereby
      explaining why the TSF cannot be bypassed), etc.</para>
        <para type="normal">
      If the available TOE design is more detailed (e.g. at the
      modular level), or the implementation representation is also
      available, then the security architecture description would be
      correspondingly more detailed, explaining how the user's process
      communicate with the TSF processes, how different requests are
      processed by the TSF, what parameters are passed, what
      programmatic protections (buffer overflow prevention, parameter
      bounds checking, time of check/time of use checking, etc.) are
      in place. Similarly, a TOE whose ST claimed the <xref id="adv_imp" show="id"/> component would go into
      implementation-specific detail.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          The explanations provided in the security architecture
          description are expected to be of sufficient detail that one
          would be able to test their accuracy. That is, simple
          assertions (e.g. "The TSF keeps domains separate'') provide
          no useful information to convince the reader that the TSF
          does indeed create and separate domains.</para>
        <subclause title="Domain Separation" id="arc_isolation"><para type="normal">
        In cases where the TOE exhibits domain separation entirely on
        its own, there would be a straightforward description of how
        this is attained. The security architecture description would
        explain the different kinds of domains that are defined by the
        TSF, how they are defined (i.e. what resources are allocated
        to each domain), how no resources are left unprotected, and
        how the domains are kept separated so that active entities in
        one domain cannot tamper with resources in another
        domain.</para><para type="normal">
        For cases where the TOE depends upon other IT entities to play
        a role in domain separation, that sharing of roles must be made
        clear. For example, a TOE that is solely application software
        relies upon the underlying operating system to correctly
        instantiate the domains that the TOE defines; if the TOE
        defines separate processing space, memory space, etc, for each
        domain, it depends upon the underlying operating system to
        operate correctly and benignly (e.g. allow the process to
        execute only in the execution space that is requested by the
        TOE software).</para><para type="normal">
        For example, mechanisms that implement domain separation
        (e.g., memory management, protected processing modes provided
        by the hardware, etc.)  would be identified and described. Or,
        the TSF might implement software protection constructs or
        coding conventions that contribute to implementing separation
        of software domains, perhaps by delineating user address space
        from system address space.</para><para type="normal">
        The vulnerability analysis and testing (see <xref id="ava_van" show="id"/>) activities will likely include attempts to defeat

          In cases where the TOE exhibits self-protection entirely

          provide domain separation to define a TSF domain that is

            For cases where the TOE depends upon other IT entities to
            play a role in protecting itself, that sharing of roles
            must be made clear. For example, a TOE that is solely
            application software relies upon the underlying operating
            system to operate correctly and benignly; the application
            cannot protect itself against a malicious operating system

            executable code or TSF data).</para>
          <para type="normal">
      The security architecture description also covers how user input
      is handled by the TSF in such a way that the TSF does not
      subject itself to being corrupted by that user input. For
      example, the TSF might implement the notion of privilege and
      protect itself by using privileged-mode routines to handle user
      data. The TSF might make use of processor-based separation
      mechanisms (e.g.  privilege levels or rings) to separate TSF
      code and data from user code and data. The TSF might implement
      software protection constructs or coding conventions that
      contribute to implementing separation of software, perhaps by
      delineating user address space from system address space.</para>

      TSF. It is likely that the evidence for <xref id="adv_fsp" show="id"/> and <xref id="adv_tds" show="id"/> can be used in
      large part to make this determination. Because non-bypassability
      is the concern, if only certain operations available through
      these TSFIs are documented (because they are SFR-enforcing) and
      others are not, the developer should consider whether additional
      information (to that presented in <xref id="adv_fsp" show="id"/>
      and <xref id="adv_tds" show="id"/>) is necessary to make a
      determination that the
      SFR-supporting and SFR-non-interfering
      operations of the TSFI do not afford an
      untrusted entity the ability to bypass the policy being
      enforced. If such information is necessary, it is included
      in the security architecture description.</para>
          <para type="normal">
            The second area of non-bypassability is concerned with
            those interfaces whose interactions are not associated
            with SFR-enforcement. Depending on the <xref id="adv_fsp" show="id"/> and <xref id="adv_tds" show="id"/> components
            claimed, some information about these interfaces may or
            may not exist in the functional specification and TOE
            design documentation. The information presented for such
            interfaces (or groups of interfaces) should be sufficient
            so that a reader can make a determination (at the level of
            detail commensurate with the rest of the evidence supplied
            in the <xref id="adv" show="link"/> class) that the
            enforcement mechanisms cannot be bypassed.</para>
          <para type="normal">
            The property that the security functionality cannot be
            bypassed applies to all security functionality
            equally. That is, the design description should cover
            objects that are protected under the SFRs (e.g. <xref id="fdp" show="id"/>_* components) and functionality
            (e.g., audit) that is provided by the TSF. The description
            should also identify the interfaces that are associated
            with security functionality; this might make use of the
            information in the functional specification. This
            description should also describe any design constructs,
            such as object managers, and their method of use.  For
            instance, if routines are to use a standard macro to
            produce an audit record, this convention is a part of the
            design that contributes to the non-bypassability of the
            audit mechanism.  It is important to note that <italic>
            non-bypassability</italic> in this context is not an
            attempt to answer the question ``could a part of the TSF
            implementation, if malicious, bypass the security
            functionality'', but rather to document how the
            implementation does not bypass the security
            functionality.</para>

        There are two parts to specifying the TSFIs: identifying them

        TSFIs.</para>

        <para type="normal">
      In order to identify the interfaces to the TSF, the parts of the
      TOE that make up the TSF must first be identified. This
      identification is actually a part of the <xref id="adv_tds" show="link"/> analysis, but is also performed implicitly
      (through identification and description of the TSFI) by the
      developer in cases where <xref id="adv_tds" show="link"/> is not
      included in the assurance package. In this analysis, a portion
      of the TOE must be considered to be in the TSF if it contributes
      to the satisfaction of an SFR in the ST (in whole or in
      part). This includes, for example, everything in the TOE that
      contributes to TSF run-time initialisation, such as software
      that runs prior to the TSF being able to protect itself because
      enforcement of the SFRs has not yet begun (e.g., while booting
      up).  Also included in the TSF are all parts of the TOE that
      contribute to the architectural principles of TSF
      self-protection, domain separation, and non-bypassability (see
      <xref id="adv_arc" show="link"/>).</para>

	Once the TSF has been defined, the TSFI are identified. 
	The TSFI consists of all means by which external entities (or 
	subjects in the TOE but outside of the TSF) supply data to the TSF, 
	receive data from the TSF and invoke services from the TSF.
	These service invocations and responses are the means of crossing 
	the TSF boundary. While many of these are readily apparent, others 
	might not be as obvious. The question that should be asked when 
	determining the TSFIs is: ``How can a potential attacker interact 
	with the TSF in an attempt to subvert the SFRs?'' The following 
	discussions illustrate the application of the TSFI definition in 
	different contexts.</para>
	<subclause title="Electrical interfaces" id="elec-IFs">
          <para type="normal">
            In TOEs such as smart cards, where the adversary has not
            only logical access to the TOE, but also complete physical
            access to the TOE, the TSF boundary is the physical
            boundary.  Therefore, the exposed electrical interfaces
            are considered TSFI because their manipulation could
            affect the behaviour of the TSF. As such, all these
            interfaces (electrical contacts) need to be described:
            various voltages that might be applied, etc.</para>
        </subclause>
	<subclause title="Network protocol stack" id="network-stack-IFs">
          <para type="normal">
            The TSFIs of a TOE that performs protocol processing would
            be those protocol layers to which a potential attacker has
            direct access. This need not be the entire protocol stack,
            but it might be.</para>
          <para type="normal">
            For example, if the TOE were some sort of a network
            appliance that allowed potential attackers to affect every
            level of the protocol stack (i.e. to send arbitrary
            signals, arbitrary voltages, arbitrary packets, arbitrary
            datagrams, etc.), then the TSF boundary exists at each
            layer of the stack.  Therefore, the functional
            specification would have to address every protocol at
            every layer of the stack.</para>
          <para type="normal">
            If, however, the TOE were a firewall that protects an
            internal network from the Internet, a potential attacker
            would have no means of directly manipulating the voltages
            that enter the TOE; any extreme voltages would simply not
            be passed though the Internet. That is, the attacker would
            have access only to those protocols at the Internet layer
            or above.  The TSF boundary exists at each layer of the
            stack. Therefore, the functional specification would have
            to address only those protocols at or above the Internet
            layer: it would describe each of the different
            communication layers at which the firewall is exposed in
            terms of what constitutes well-formed input for what might
            appear on the line, and the result of both well-formed and
            malformed inputs. For example, the description of the
            Internet protocol layer would describe what constitutes a
            well-formed IP packet and what happens when both
            correctly-formed and malformed packets are
            received. Likewise, the description of the TCP layer would
            describe a successful TCP connection and what happens both
            when successful connections are established and when
            connections cannot be established or are inadvertently
            dropped.  Presuming the firewall's purpose is to filter
            application-level commands (like FTP or telnet), the
            description of the application layer would describe the
            application-level commands that are recognised and
            filtered by the firewall, as well as the results of
            encountering unknown commands.</para>

        The wide variety of TOEs makes it impossible to codify
        anything more specific than ``well-structured'' or ``minimum
        complexity''.  Judgements on structure and complexity are
        expected to be derived from the specific technologies used in
        the TOE. For example, software is likely to be considered
        well-structured if it exhibits the characteristics cited in
        the software engineering disciplines.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        This annex provides supplementary material on assessing the
        structure and complexity of procedure-based software portions
        of the TSF. This material is based on information readily
        available in software engineering literature. For other kinds
        of internals (e.g. hardware, non-procedural software such as
        object-oriented code, etc.), corresponding literature on good
        practises should be consulted.</para>
      <subclause title="Structure of procedural software" id="software-structure">
        <para type="normal">
          The structure of procedural software is traditionally
          assessed according to its
          <italic>modularity</italic>. Software written with a modular
          design aids in achieving understandability by clarifying
          what dependencies a module has on other modules
          (<italic>coupling</italic>) and by including in a module
          only tasks that are strongly related to each other
          (<italic>cohesion</italic>). The use of modular design
          reduces the interdependence between elements of the TSF and
          thus reduces the risk that a change or error in one module
          will have effects throughout the TOE. Its use enhances
          clarity of design and provides for increased assurance that
          unexpected effects do not occur. Additional desirable
          properties of modular decomposition are a reduction in the
          amount of redundant or unneeded code.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          Minimising the amount of functionality in the TSF allows the
          evaluator as well as the developer to focus only on that
          functionality which is necessary for SFR enforcement,
          contributing further to understandability and further
          lowering the likelihood of design or implementation
          errors.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          The incorporation of modular decomposition, layering and
          minimisation into the design and implementation process must
          be accompanied by sound software engineering
          considerations. A practical, useful software system will
          usually entail some undesirable coupling among modules, some
          modules that include loosely-related functions, and some
          subtlety or complexity in a module's design. These
          deviations from the ideals of modular decomposition are
          often deemed necessary to achieve some goal or constraint,
          be it related to performance, compatibility, future planned
          functionality, or some other factors, and may be acceptable,
          based on the developer's justification for them. In applying
          the requirements of this class, due consideration must be
          given to sound software engineering principles; however, the
          overall objective of achieving understandability must be

                inappropriately placed, and should be removed.  Other
                factors that need to be considered in assessing the

                <list type="enumerated">
                  <item>The number of modules that modify a global
                    variable: In general, only a single module should
                    be allocated the responsibility for controlling
                    the contents of a global variable, but there may
                    be situations in which a second module may share
                    that responsibility; in such a case, sufficient
                    justification must be provided. It is unacceptable
                    for this responsibility to be shared by more than
                    two modules. (In making this assessment, care
                    should be given to determining the module actually
                    responsible for the contents of the variable; for
                    example, if a single routine is used to modify the
                    variable, but that routine simply performs the
                    modification requested by its caller, it is the
                    calling module that is responsible, and there may
                    be more than one such module).  Further, as part
                    of the complexity determination, if two modules
                    are responsible for the contents of a global

                  <item>The number of modules that reference a global

                    the number of modules that reference a global
                    variable, cases in which many modules make such a
                    reference should be examined for validity and

                referencing labels internal to, the other module).
                The result is that some or all of the content of one
                module are effectively included in the other. Content
                coupling can be thought of as using unadvertised
                module interfaces; this is in contrast to call

          <italic>subsystems</italic> at lower assurance levels,
          <italic>modules</italic> at higher levels). In cases where a
          lower level of abstraction (modules) is presented,
          requirements levied on higher-level abstractions
          (subsystems) are essentially met by default. This concept is

        <para type="normal">
          The developer is expected to describe the design of the TOE
          in terms of <italic>subsystems</italic>. The term
          ``subsystem'' was chosen to be specifically vague so that it
          could refer to units appropriate to the TOE (e.g.,
          subsystems, modules). subsystems can even be uneven in
          scope, as long as the requirements for description of
          subsystems are met.</para>
        <para type="normal">
      The first use of subsystems is to distinguish the TSF boundary;
      that is, the portions of the TOE that comprise the TSF. In
      general, a subsystem is part of the TSF if it has the capability
      (whether by design or implementation) to affect the correct
      operation of any of the SFRs. For example, for software that
      depends on different hardware execution modes to provide domain
      separation (see <xref id="arc_annex" show="link"/>) where
      SFR-enforcing code is executed in one domain, then all
      subsystems that execute in that domain would be considered part
      of the TSF. Likewise, if a server outside that domain
      implemented an SFR (e.g. enforced an access control policy over
      objects it managed), then it too would be considered part of the
      TSF.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          The second use of subsystems is to provide a structure for
          describing the TSF at a level of description that, while
          describing how the TSF works, does not necessarily contain
          low-level implementation detail found in module descriptions
          (discussed later). subsystems are described at either a high
          level (lacking an abundance of implementation detail) or a
          detailed level (providing more insight into the
          implementation). The level of description provided for a
          subsystem is determined by the degree to which that
          subsystem is responsible for implementing an SFR.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          An <italic>SFR-enforcing</italic> subsystem is a subsystem

          for enforcing an SFR. If a subsystem provides (implements)

          subsystem is one that is depended on by an SFR-enforcing
          subsystem in order to implement an SFR, but does not play as
          direct a role as an SFR-enforcing subsystem. An
          SFR-non-interfering subsystem is one that is not depended

          separate entities) merely serve to put to the module
          descriptions in context. That is, it is not necessary to
          provide detailed subsystem descriptions if module
          descriptions exist. In TOEs that are sufficiently simple, a
          separate ``subsystem description'' is not necessary; the
          requirements can be met through documentation provided by
          modules. For complex TOEs, the purpose of the subsystem
          description (with respect to the TSF) is to provide the
          reader context so they can focus their analysis
          appropriately. This difference is illustrated in Figure
          <xref show="link" id="components-and-modules"/>.</para>

     An SFR-enforcing module is a module that completely or partially implements
     a security functional requirement (SFR) in the ST. Such modules may 
     implement an SFR-enforcing TSFI, but some functionality expressed in an SFR (for example, 
     audit and object re-use functionality) may not be directly tied to a single TSFI. As was 
     the case with subsystems, SFR-supporting modules are those modules that are depended upon by 
     an SFR-enforcing module, but are not responsible for directly implementing an SFR. 
     SFR-non-interfering modules are those modules that do not deal, directly or indirectly, 
     with the enforcement of SFRs.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          It is important to note that the determination of what
          ``directly implements'' means is somewhat subjective. In the
          narrowest sense of the term, it could be interpreted to mean
          the one or two lines of code that actually perform a
          comparison, zeroing operation, etc. that implements a
          requirement. A broader interpretation might be that it
          includes the module that is invoked in response to a
          SFR-enforcing TSFI, and all modules that may be invoked in
          turn by that module (and so on until the completion of the
          call). Neither of these interpretations is particularly
          satisfying, since the narrowness of the first interpretation
          may lead to important modules being incorrectly categorised
          as SFR supporting, while the second leads to modules that
          are actually not SFR-enforcing being classified as
          such.</para>
        <para type="normal">
	A description of a module should be such that one could create an implementation of the 
	module from the description, and the resulting implementation would be 1) identical to 
	the actual TSF implementation in terms of the interfaces presented, 2) identical in the 
	use of interfaces that are mentioned in the design, and 3) functionally equivalent to the 
	description of the purpose of the TSF module. For instance, RFC 793 
	provides a high-level description of the TCP protocol. It is necessarily implementation 
	independent. While it provides a wealth of detail, it is 
	<bold><italic>not</italic></bold>
	a suitable design description because it is not specific to an implementation. An actual 
	implementation can add to the protocol specified in the RFC, and implementation choices 
	(for example, the use of global data vs. local data in various parts of the implementation) 
	may have an impact on the analysis that is performed. The design description of the TCP 
	module would list the interfaces presented by the implementation (rather than just those 
	defined in RFC 793), as well as an algorithm description of the processing associated with 
	the modules implementing TCP (assuming they were part of the TSF).</para>
        <para type="normal">
      In the design, modules are described in detail in terms 
	of the function they provide (the purpose); the interfaces
	they present (when required by the criteria); the return 
	values from such interfaces; the interfaces (presented by other modules) 
	they use (provided those interfaces are required to be also described); 
	and a description of how they provide their functionality using a 
	technique appropriate to the method used to implement the module.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          The purpose of a module should be described indicating what
          function the module is providing. It should be sufficient so
          that the reader could get a general idea of what the
          module's function is in the architecture.</para>
        <para type="normal">
     	The interfaces presented by a module are those interfaces used by 
	other modules to invoke the functionality provided. Interfaces include both 
	<italic>explicit</italic> interfaces (e.g., a calling sequence invoked by 
	other modules) as well as <italic>implicit</italic> interfaces (e.g., global 
	data manipulated by the module). Interfaces are described in terms of how 
	they are invoked, and any values that are returned. This description would 
	include a list of parameters, and descriptions of these parameters. If a parameter 
	were expected to take on a set of values (e.g., a ``flag'' parameter), the complete set 
	of values the parameter could take on that would have an effect on module processing 
	would be specified. Likewise, parameters representing data structures are described 
	such that each field of the data structure is identified and described. 
	Global data should be described to the extent required to understand their purpose. 
	The level of description required for a global data structure needs to be identical 
	to the one for module interfaces, where the input parameter and return values correspond
	to the individual fields and their possible values in the data structure. Global data 
	structures may be described separate from the modules that manipulate or read them as 
	long as the design of the modules contain sufficient information about the global data
	structures updated or the information extracted from global data structures.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          Note that different programming languages may have
          additional ``interfaces'' that would be non-obvious; an
          example would be operator/function overloading in C++. This
          ``implicit interface'' in the class description would also
          be described as part of the module design. Note that
          although a module could present only one interface, it is
          more common that a module presents a small set of related
          interfaces.</para>
        <para type="normal">
	When it is required to describe the interfaces used by a module, it must be 
	clear from either the design description of the module or the purpose of the 
	module called, what service is expected from the module called. For example if 
	Module A is being described, and it uses Module B's bubble sort routine, the 
	description of the interaction between modules must allow to identify why 
	Module B's bubble sort routine is called and what this call contributes to the 
	implementation of the SFRs. The interface and purpose of Module B's bubble sort 
	routine must be described as part of the interfaces of Module B (provided the 
	level of ADV_TDS and the classification of Module B require a description its 
	interfaces) and so Module A just needs to identify what data it needs to have 
	sorted using this routine. An adequate description would be: "Module A invokes 
	Module B's interface <italic>double_bubble()</italic> to sort the usernames in 
	alphabetical order".</para><para type="normal">
	Note that if this sorting of the user names is not important for the enforcement of 
	any SFR (e. g. it is just done to speed up things and an algorithmically identical 
	implementation of Module A could also avoid to have the usernames sorted), the use of 
	Module B's bubble sort routine is not SFR-enforcing and it is suffcient to explain in 
	the description of Module A that the usernames are sorted in alphabetical order to 
	enhance performance. Module B may be classified as "SFR-supporting" only and the level 
	of ADV_TDS chosen indicates if the interfaces of SFR-supporting modules need to be 
	described or if its is sufficient to just describe the purpose of Module B.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          As discussed previously, the algorithmic description of the
          module should describe in an algorithmic fashion the
          implementation of the module. This can be done in
          pseudo-code, through flow charts, or (at <xref id="adv_tds.3" show="link"/>) informal text. It discusses
          how the module inputs and called functions are used to
          accomplish the module's function. It notes changes to global
          data, system state, and return values produced by the
          module. It is at the level of detail that an implementation
          could be derived that would be very similar to the actual
          implementation of the TOE.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          It should be noted that source code does not meet the module
          documentation requirements. Although the module design
          describes the implementation, it is <italic>not</italic> the
          implementation. The comments surrounding the source code
          might be sufficient documentation if they provide an
          explanation of the intent of the source code. In-line
          comments that merely state what each line of code is doing
          are useless because they provide no explanation of what the
          module is meant to accomplish.</para>

          In the elements below, the labels (SFR-enforcing,
          SFR-supporting, and SFR-non-interfering) discussed for
          subsystems and modules are used to describe the amount and
          type of information that needs to be made available by the
          developer. The elements have been structured so that there
          is no expectation that the developer provide
          <italic>only</italic> the information specified. That is, if
          the developer's documentation of the TSF provides the

          expectation that the developer update their documentation
          and label subsystems and modules as SFR-enforcing,
          SFR-supporting, and SFR-non-interfering. The primary purpose
          of this labelling is to allow developers with less mature
          development methodologies (and associated artifacts, such as
          detailed interface and design documentation) to provide the
          necessary evidence without undue cost.</para>

          Because there is subjectivity in determining what is
          SFR-enforcing vs. SFR-supporting (and in some cases, even
          determining what is SFR-non-interfering) the following
          paradigm has been adopted in this family. In early
          components of the family, the developer makes a
          determination about the classification of the subsystems
          into SFR-enforcing, etc., supplying the appropriate
          information, and there is little additional evidence for the
          evaluator to examine to support this claim. As the level of
          desired assurance increases, while the developer still makes
          a classification determination, the evaluator obtains more
          and more evidence that is used to confirm the developer's
          classification.</para>

      In order to focus the evaluator's analysis on the SFR-related
      portions of the TOE, especially at lower levels of assurance,
      the components of the family are levelled such that initially
      detailed information is required only for SFR-enforcing
      architectural entities. As the level of assurance increases,
      more information is required for SFR-supporting and (eventually)
      SFR-non-interfering entities. It should be noted that even when
      complete information is required, it is not required that all of
      this information be analysed in the same level of detail. The

        The CC philosophy is to provide assurance based upon an
        evaluation (active investigation) of the IT product that is to
        be trusted. Evaluation has been the traditional means of
        providing assurance and is the basis for prior evaluation
        criteria documents. In aligning the existing approaches, the
        CC adopts the same philosophy. The CC proposes measuring the
        validity of the documentation and of the resulting IT product

                those interfaces. For example, gaining access to
                functionality that is implemented at a lower level
                than that at which access control is
                enforced. Relevant items include:

                Changing the predefined sequence of invocation of
                components should be considered where there is an
                expected order in which interfaces to the TOE
                (e.g. user commands) are called to invoke a TSFI
                (e.g. opening a file for access and then reading data
                from it). If a TSFI is invoked through one of the TOE
                interfaces (e.g. an access control check), the
                evaluator should consider whether it is possible to
                bypass the control by performing the call at a later
                point in the sequence or by missing it out altogether.

                Executing an additional component (in the predefined
                sequence) is a similar form of attack to the one
                described above, but involves the calling of some
                other TOE interface at some point in the sequence. It
                can also involve attacks based on interception of
                sensitive data passed over a network by use of network
                traffic analysers (the additional component here being
                the network traffic analyser).

              <item>
                Using a component in an unexpected context or for an
                unexpected purpose includes using an unrelated TOE
                interface to bypass the TSF by using it to achieve a
                purpose that it was not designed or intended to
                achieve. Covert channels are an example of this type
                of attack (see <xref id="ava_van_monitor" show="link"/> for further discussion of covert
                channels).  The use of undocumented interfaces, which
                may be insecure, also falls into this category.  Such
                interfaces may include undocumented support and help
                facilities.

                Using implementation detail introduced in lower
                representations may allow an attacker to take
                advantage of additional functions, resources or
                attributes that are introduced to the TOE as a
                consequence of the refinement process. Additional
                functionality may include test harness code contained
                in software modules and back-doors introduced during
                the implementation process.

                Using the delay between time of check and time of use
                includes scenarios where an access control check is
                made and access granted, and an attacker is
                subsequently able to create conditions in which, had
                they applied at the time the access check was made,
                would have caused the check to fail. An example would
                be a user creating a background process to read and
                send highly sensitive data to the user's terminal, and
                then logging out and logging back in again at a lower
                sensitivity level. If the background process is not
                terminated when the user logs off, the MAC checks
                would have been effectively bypassed.

                Attacks based on inheriting privileges are generally
                based on illicitly acquiring the privileges or
                capabilities of some privileged component, usually by
                exiting from it in an uncontrolled or unexpected
                manner. Relevant items include:

                Executing data not intended to be executable, or
                making it executable includes attacks involving
                viruses (e.g. putting executable code or commands in a
                file which are automatically executed when the file is
                edited or accessed, thus inheriting any privileges the
                owner of the file has).

              <item>
                Generating unexpected input for a component can have
                unexpected effects which an attacker could take
                advantage of. For example, if the TSF could be
                bypassed if a user gains access to the underlying
                operating system, it may be possible to gain such
                access following the login sequence by exploring the
                effect of hitting various control or escape sequences
                whilst a password is being authenticated.

              <item>
                Invalidating assumptions and properties on which lower
                level components rely includes attacks based on
                breaking out of the constraints of an application to
                gain access to an underlying operating system in order
                to bypass the TSF of an application. In this case the
                assumption being invalidated is that it is not
                possible for a user of the application to gain such
                access. A similar attack can be envisaged against an
                application on an underlying database management
                system: again the TSF could be bypassed if an attacker
                can break out of the constraints of the application.

                Attacks based on reading sensitive data stored in
                inadequately protected areas (applicable where
                confidentiality is a concern) include the following
                issues which should be considered as possible means of
                gaining access to sensitive data:

                    and found directory for headerless files, which
                    are on disk without labels. If the TOE implements
                    mandatory access controls, it is important to
                    investigate at what security level this directory
                    is kept (e.g. at system high), and who has access
                    to this directory.

                Invalidating assumptions and properties on which
                lower-level components rely includes attacks taking
                advantage of errors in the source code where the code
                assumes (explicitly or implicitly) that security
                relevant data is in a particular format or has a
                particular range of values. In these cases the
                evaluator should determine whether they can invalidate
                such assumptions by causing the data to be in a
                different format or to have different values, and if
                so whether this could confer advantage to an attacker.

                The correct behaviour of the TSF may be dependent on

                parameters reach their maximum value. The evaluator
                should consider (where practical) the behaviour of the

                attempt simultaneous access, but that the behaviour
                becomes less well defined in the presence of further
                subjects. For example, a critical security process

        </table>
        <para type="normal">
          The ``beyond high'' entry in the residual vulnerabilities
          column of the above table represents those potential
          vulnerabilities that would require an attacker to have an
          attack potential greater than that of ``high'' in order to
          exploit the potential vulnerability. A vulnerability
          classified as residual in this instance reflects the fact
          that a known weakness exists in the TOE, but in the current
          operational environment, with the assumed attack potential,
          the weakness cannot be exploited.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          At any level of attack potential a potential vulnerability
          may be deemed ``infeasible'' due to a countermeasure in the
          operational environment that prevents the vulnerability from
          being exploited.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          A vulnerability analysis applies to all TSFI, including ones
          that access probabilistic or permutational mechanisms. No
          assumptions are made regarding the correctness of the design
          and implementation of the TSFI; nor are constraints placed
          on the attack method or the attacker's interaction with the
          TOE - if an attack is possible, then it is to be considered
          during the vulnerability analysis. As shown in Table <xref id="table_vt_ap" show="link"/>, successful evaluation
          against a vulnerability assurance component reflects that
          the TSF is designed and implemented to protect against the
          required level of threat.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          It is not necessary for an evaluator to perform an attack
          potential calculation for each potential vulnerability. In
          some cases it is apparent when developing the attack method
          whether or not the attack potential required to develop and
          run the attack method is commensurate with that assumed of
          the attacker in the operational environment. For any
          vulnerabilities for which an exploitation is determined, the
          evaluator performs an attack potential calculation to
          determine that the exploitation is appropriate to the level
          of attack potential assumed for the attacker.</para>
        <para type="normal">
      The approach described below is to be applied whenever it is
      necessary to calculate attack potential, unless the evaluation
      authority provides mandatory guidance that an alternative
      approach is to be applied.  The values given in Tables <xref id="ap_factors" show="id"/> and <xref id="ap_rating" show="id"/>
      below are not mathematically proven. Therefore, the values given
      in these example tables may need to be adjusted according to the
      technology type and specific environments. The evaluator should
      seek guidance from the evaluation authority.</para>

      <subclause title="Application of attack potential" id="app_w_p">
        <para type="normal">
          Attack potential is a function of expertise, resources and
          motivation. There are multiple methods of representing and
          quantifying these factors. Also, there may be other factors
          that are applicable for particular TOE types.</para>
        <subclause title="Treatment of motivation" id="treatment_motivation">
          <para type="normal">
            Motivation is an attack potential factor that can be used
            to describe several aspects related to the attacker and
            the assets the attacker desires. Firstly, motivation can
            imply the likelihood of an attack - one can infer from a
            threat described as highly motivated that an attack is
            imminent, or that no attack is anticipated from an
            un-motivated threat. However, except for the two extreme
            levels of motivation, it is difficult to derive a
            probability of an attack occurring from motivation.</para>
          <para type="normal">
            Secondly, motivation can imply the value of the asset,
            monetarily or otherwise, to either the attacker or the
            asset holder. An asset of very high value is more likely
            to motivate an attack compared to an asset of little
            value. However, other than in a very general way, it is
            difficult to relate asset value to motivation because the
            value of an asset is subjective - it depends largely upon
            the value an asset holder places on it.</para>
          <para type="normal">
            Thirdly, motivation can imply the expertise and resources
            with which an attacker is willing to effect an attack. One
            can infer that a highly motivated attacker is likely to
            acquire sufficient expertise and resources to defeat the
            measures protecting an asset. Conversely, one can infer
            that an attacker with significant expertise and resources
            is not willing to effect an attack using them if the
            attacker's motivation is low.</para>
          <para type="normal">
            During the course of preparing for and conducting an
            evaluation, all three aspects of motivation are at some
            point considered. The first aspect, likelihood of attack,
            is what may inspire a developer to pursue an
            evaluation. If the developer believes that the attackers
            are sufficiently motivated to mount an attack, then an
            evaluation can provide assurance of the ability of the TOE
            to thwart the attacker's efforts. Where the operational
            environment is well defined, for example in a system
            evaluation, the level of motivation for an attack may be
            known, and will influence the selection of
            countermeasures.</para>
          <para type="normal">
            Considering the second aspect, an asset holder may believe
            that the value of the assets (however measured) is
            sufficient to motivate attack against them. Once an
            evaluation is deemed necessary, the attacker's motivation
            is considered to determine the methods of attack that may
            be attempted, as well as the expertise and resources used
            in those attacks. Once examined, the developer is able to
            choose the appropriate assurance level, in particular the
            <xref id="ava" show="id"/> requirement components,
            commensurate with the attack potential for the
            threats. During the course of the evaluation, and in
            particular as a result of completing the vulnerability
            assessment activity, the evaluator determines whether or
            not the TOE, operating in its operational environment, is
            sufficient to thwart attackers with the identified
            expertise and resources.</para>
          <para type="normal">
            It may be possible for a PP author to quantify the
            motivation of an attacker, as the PP author has greater
            knowledge of the operational environment in which the TOE
            (conforming to the requirements of the PP) is to be
            placed. Therefore, the motivation could form an explicit
            part of the expression of the attack potential in the PP,
            along with the necessary methods and measures to quantify
            the motivation.</para>

      <subclause title="Characterising attack potential" id="characterising_attack_potential">
        <para type="normal">
          This section examines the factors that determine attack
          potential, and provides some guidelines to help remove some
          of the subjectivity from this aspect of the evaluation
          process.</para>
        <subclause title="Determining the attack potential" id="determine_ap">
          <para type="normal">
      The determination of the attack potential for an attack
      corresponds to the identification of the effort required to
      create the attack, and to demonstrate that it can be
      successfully applied to the TOE (including setting up or
      building any necessary test equipment), thereby exploiting the
      vulnerability in the TOE. The demonstration that the attack can
      be successfully applied needs to consider any difficulties in
      expanding a result shown in the laboratory to create a useful
      attack. For example, where an experiment reveals some bits or
      bytes of a confidential data item (such as a key), it is
      necessary to consider how the remainder of the data item would
      be obtained (in this example some bits might be measured
      directly by further experiments, while others might be found by
      a different technique such as exhaustive search). It may not be
      necessary to carry out all of the experiments to identify the
      full attack, provided it is clear that the attack actually
      proves that access has been gained to a TOE asset, and that the
      complete attack could realistically be carried out in
      exploitation according to the <xref id="ava_van" show="id"/>
      component targeted. In some cases the only way to prove that an
      attack can realistically be carried out in exploitation
      according to the <xref id="ava_van" show="id"/> component
      targeted is to perform completely the attack and 
      then rate it based upon the resources actually required.
      One of the outputs from the identification of a potential
      vulnerability is assumed to be a script that gives a
      step-by-step description of how to carry out the attack that can
      be used in the exploitation of the vulnerability on another
      instance of the TOE.</para>
          <para type="normal">
            In many cases, the evaluators will estimate the parameters
            for exploitation, rather than carry out the full
            exploitation. The estimates and their rationale will be
            documented in the ETR.</para>

          <para type="normal">
            The following factors should be considered during analysis

                the probability to destroy the TOE during the attack
                instead of being successful is very high and the

                Standard equipment is readily available to the
                attacker, either for the identification of a
                vulnerability or for an attack. This equipment may be
                a part of the TOE itself (e.g. a debugger in an
                operating system), or can be readily obtained
                (e.g. Internet downloads, protocol analyser or simple
                attack scripts).
              </item>
              <item>
      Specialised equipment is not readily available to the attacker,
      but could be acquired without undue effort. This could include
      purchase of moderate amounts of equipment (e.g. power analysis
      tools, use of hundreds of PCs linked across the Internet would
      fall into this category), or development of more extensive
      attack scripts or programs. If clearly different test benches
      consisting of specialised equipment are required for distinct
      steps of an attack this would be rated as bespoke.

              <item>
                Bespoke equipment is not readily available to the
                public as it may need to be specially produced
                (e.g. very sophisticated software), or because the
                equipment is so specialised that its distribution is
                controlled, possibly even restricted. Alternatively,
                the equipment may be very expensive. </item>

            Specialist expertise and <bold><italic>Knowledge of the
              TOE</italic></bold> are concerned with the information
              required for persons to be able to attack a TOE. There
              is an implicit relationship between an attacker's
              expertise (where the attacker may be one or more persons
              with complementary areas of knowledge) and the ability
              to effectively make use of equipment in an attack. The
              weaker the attacker's expertise, the lower the potential
              to use equipment (IT hardware/software or other
              equipment). Likewise, the greater the expertise, the
              greater the potential for equipment to be used in the
              attack. Although implicit, this relationship between
              expertise and the use of equipment does not always
              apply, for instance, when environmental measures prevent
              an expert attacker's use of equipment, or when, through
              the efforts of others, attack tools requiring little
              expertise to be effectively used are created and freely
              distributed (e.g. via the Internet).</para>

      perform the attack then a value between one and four may be
      selected for that factor, or if the design is based on a
      publicly available design but the developer has made some

            specified in the preceding ranges associated with this

            particular reason the potential vulnerability cannot be
            exploited in the TOE in its intended operational
            environment. For example, access to the TOE may be
            detected after a certain amount of time in a TOE with a
            known environment (i.e. in the case of a system) where
            regular patrols are completed, and the attacker could not
            gain access to the TOE for the required two weeks
            undetected. However, this would not be applicable to a TOE
            connected to the network where remote access is possible,
            or where the physical environment of the TOE is
            unknown.</para>

            An approach such as this cannot take account of every
            circumstance or factor, but should give a better
            indication of the level of resistance to attack required
            to achieve the standard ratings. Other factors, such as
            the reliance on unlikely chance occurrences are not
            included in the basic model, but can be used by an
            evaluator as justification for a rating other than those
            that the basic model might indicate.</para>
          <para type="normal">
            It should be noted that whereas a number of
            vulnerabilities rated individually may indicate high
            resistance to attack, collectively the combination of
            vulnerabilities may indicate that overall a lower rating
            is applicable. The presence of one vulnerability may make
            another easier to exploit.</para>
          <para type="normal">
      If a PP/ST author wants to use the attack potential table for
      the determination of the level of attack the TOE should
      withstand (selection of Vulnerability analysis (<xref id="ava_van" show="id"/>) component), he should proceed as
      follows: For all different attack scenarios (i.e. for all
      different types of attacker and/or different types of attack the
      author has in mind) which must not violate the SFRs, several
      passes through Table <xref id="ap_factors" show="id"/> should be
      made to determine the different values of attack potential
      assumed for each such unsuccessful attack scenario.  The PP/ST
      author then chooses the highest value of them in order to
      determine the level of the TOE resistance to be claimed from
      Table <xref id="ap_rating" show="id"/>: the TOE resistance must
      be at least equal to this highest value determined.  For
      example, the highest value of attack potentials of all attack
      scenarios, which must not undermine the TOE security policy,
      determined in such a way is Moderate; hence, the TOE resistance
      shall be at least Moderate (i.e. Moderate or High); therefore,
      the PP/ST author can choose either <xref id="ava_van.4" show="id"/> (for Moderate) or <xref id="ava_van.5" show="id"/>
      (for High) as the appropriate assurance component.</para>

        Mechanisms subject to direct attack are often vital for system
        security and developers often strengthen these mechanisms. As
        an example, a TOE might use a simple pass number
        authentication mechanism that can be overcome by an attacker
        who has the opportunity to repeatedly guess another user's
        pass number. The system can strengthen this mechanism by
        restricting pass numbers and their use in various ways. During
        the course of the evaluation an analysis of this direct attack
        could proceed as follows:</para>
      <para type="normal">
        Information gleaned from the ST and design evidence reveals
        that identification and authentication provides the basis upon
        which to control access to network resources from widely
        distributed terminals. Physical access to the terminals is not
        controlled by any effective means. The duration of access to a
        terminal is not controlled by any effective means. Authorised
        users of the system choose their own pass numbers when
        initially authorised to use the system, and thereafter upon
        user request. The system places the following restrictions on
        the pass numbers selected by the user:
        <list type="enumerated">
          <item>
            the pass number must be at least four and no greater than
            six digits long;
          </item>
          <item>
            consecutive numerical sequences are disallowed (such as
            7,6,5,4,3);

        Guidance provided to the users at the time of pass number
        selection is that pass numbers should be as random as possible

        date of birth, for instance.</para>

      The Composed Assurance Packages (CAPs) provide an increasing
      scale that balances the level of assurance obtained with the
      cost and feasibility of acquiring that degree of assurance for
      composed TOEs.</para>
    <para type="normal">
      It is important to note that there are only a small number of
      families and components from CC Part 3 included in the
      CAPs. This is due to their nature of building upon evaluation
      results of previously evaluated entities (base components and
      dependent components), and is not to say that these do not
      provide meaningful and desirable assurances.</para>
    <subclause title="Composed assurance package (CAP) overview" id="cap-overview">
      <para type="normal">
        CAPs are to be applied to composed TOEs, which are comprised
        of components that have been (are going through) component TOE
        evaluation (see <xref id="aco-annex" show="link"/>). The
        individual components will have been certified to an EAL or
        another assurance package specified in the ST. It is expected
        that a basic level of assurance in a composed TOE will be
        gained through application of EAL1, which can be achieved with
        information about the components that is generally available
        in the public domain. (EAL1 can be applied as specified
        within to both component and composed TOEs.) CAPs provide an
        alternative approach to obtaining higher levels of assurance
        for a composed TOE than application of the EALs above
        EAL1.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        While a dependent component can be evaluated using a
        previously evaluated and certified base component to satisfy
        the IT platform requirements in the environment, this does not
        provide any formal assurance of the interactions between the
        components or the possible introduction of vulnerabilities
        resulting from the composition. Composed assurance packages
        consider these interactions and, at higher levels of
        assurance, ensure that the interface between the components
        has itself been the subject of testing. A vulnerability
        analysis of the composed TOE is also performed to consider the
        possible introduction of vulnerabilities as a result of
        composing the components.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        Table <xref show="link" id="table-cap"/> represents a summary

        set of CAPs, while the rows represent assurance families. Each

        component where applicable.</para>

        As outlined in the next Subclause, three hierarchically
        ordered composed assurance packages are defined in the CC for
        the rating of a composed TOE's assurance. They are
        hierarchically ordered inasmuch as each CAP represents more
        assurance than all lower CAPs. The increase in assurance from
        CAP to CAP is accomplished by substitution of a hierarchically
        higher assurance component from the same assurance family
        (i.e. increasing rigour, scope, and/or depth) and from the
        addition of assurance components from other assurance families
        (i.e. adding new requirements). These increases result in
        greater analysis of the composition to identify the impact on
        the evaluation results gained for the individual component
        TOEs.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        These CAPs consist of an appropriate combination of assurance
        components as described in Clause <xref show="link" id="security-assurance-requirements"/> of this CC Part 3. More
        precisely, each CAP includes no more than one component of
        each assurance family and all assurance dependencies of every
        component are addressed.</para>
      <para type="normal">
      The CAPs only consider resistance against an attacker with an
      attack potential up to Enhanced-Basic. This is due to the level
      of design information that can be provided through the <xref id="aco_dev" show="id"/>, limiting some of the factors
      associated with attack potential (knowledge of the composed TOE)
      and subsequently affecting the rigour of vulnerability analysis
      that can be performed by the evaluator. Therefore, the level of
      assurance in the composed TOE is limited, although the assurance
      in the individual components within the composed TOE may be much
      higher.</para>

        component where applicable.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        As outlined in the next Subclause, seven hierarchically
        ordered evaluation assurance levels are defined in the CC for
        the rating of a TOE's assurance. They are hierarchically
        ordered inasmuch as each EAL represents more assurance than
        all lower EALs. The increase in assurance from EAL to EAL is
        accomplished by substitution of a hierarchically higher
        assurance component from the same assurance family
        (i.e. increasing rigour, scope, and/or depth) and from the
        addition of assurance components from other assurance families
        (i.e. adding new requirements).</para>
      <para type="normal">
        These EALs consist of an appropriate combination of assurance
        components as described in Clause <xref show="link" id="security-assurance-requirements"/> of this CC Part 3. More
        precisely, each EAL includes no more than one component of
        each assurance family and all assurance dependencies of every
        component are addressed.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        While the EALs are defined in the CC, it is possible to
        represent other combinations of assurance. Specifically, the
        notion of ``augmentation'' allows the addition of assurance
        components (from assurance families not already included in
        the EAL) or the substitution of assurance components (with
        another hierarchically higher assurance component in the same
        assurance family) to an EAL. Of the assurance constructs
        defined in the CC, only EALs may be augmented. The notion of
        an ``EAL minus a constituent assurance component'' is not
        recognised by the standard as a valid claim. Augmentation
        carries with it the obligation on the part of the claimant to
        justify the utility and added value of the added assurance
        component to the EAL. An EAL may also be augmented with
        extended assurance requirements.</para>

        This Subclause provides general guidance on sampling. Specific
        and detailed information is given in those work units under
        the specific evaluator action elements where sampling has to
        be performed.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        Sampling is a defined procedure of an evaluator whereby some
        subset of a required set of evaluation evidence is examined
        and assumed to be representative for the entire set. It allows
        the evaluator to gain enough confidence in the correctness of
        particular evaluation evidence without analysing the whole
        evidence. The reason for sampling is to conserve resources
        while maintaining an adequate level of assurance. Sampling of
        the evidence can provide two possible outcomes:
        <list type="enumerated">
          <item>
            The subset reveals no errors, allowing the evaluator to
            have some confidence that the entire set is correct.
          </item>
          <item>
            The subset reveals errors and therefore the validity of
            the entire set is called into question. Even the
            resolution of all errors that were found may be
            insufficient to provide the evaluator the necessary
            confidence and as a result the evaluator may have to
            increase the size of the subset, or stop using sampling
            for this particular evidence.
          </item>
        </list></para>
      <para type="normal">
        Sampling is a technique which can be used to reach a reliable
        conclusion if a set of evidence is relatively homogeneous in
        nature, e.g. if the evidence has been produced during a well
        defined process.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        Sampling in the cases identified in the CC, and in cases
        specifically covered in CEM work items, is recognised as a
        cost-effective approach to performing evaluator
        actions. Sampling in other areas is permitted only in
        exceptional cases, where performance of a particular activity
        in its entirety would require effort disproportionate to the
        other evaluation activities, and where this would not add
        correspondingly to assurance. In such cases a rationale for
        the use of sampling in that area will need to be made. Neither
        the fact that the TOE is large and complex, nor that it has
        many security functional requirements, is sufficient
        justification, since evaluations of large, complex TOEs can be
        expected to require more effort.  Rather it is intended that
        this exception be limited to cases such as that where the TOE
        development approach yields large quantities of material for a
        particular CC requirement that would normally all need to be
        checked or examined, and where such an action would not be
        expected to raise assurance correspondingly.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        Sampling needs to be justified taking into account the
        possible impact on the security objectives and threats of the
        TOE. The impact depends on what might be missed as a result of
        sampling. Consideration also needs to be given to the nature
        of the evidence to be sampled, and the requirement not to
        diminish or ignore any security functions.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        It should be recognised that sampling of evidence directly
        related to the implementation of the TOE (e.g. developer test
        results) requires a different approach to sampling, then
        sampling related to the determination of whether a process is
        being followed. In many cases the evaluator is required to
        determine that a process is being followed, and a sampling
        strategy is recommended. The approach for sampling a
        developer's test results will differ. This is because the
        former case is concerned with ensuring that a process is in
        place, and the latter deals with determining correct
        implementation of the TOE. Typically, larger sample sizes
        should be analysed in cases related to the correct
        implementation of the TOE than would be necessary to ensure
        that a process is in place.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        In certain cases it may be appropriate for the evaluator to
        give greater emphasis to the repetition of developer
        testing. For example if the independent tests left for the
        evaluator to perform would be only superficially different
        from those included in an extensive developer test set
        (possibly because the developer has performed more testing
        than necessary to satisfy the <xref id="ate_cov" show="link"/>
        and <xref id="ate_dpt" show="link"/> criteria) then it would
        be appropriate for the evaluator to give greater focus to the
        repetition of developer tests. Note that this does not
        necessarily imply a requirement for a high percentage sample
        for repetition of developer tests; indeed, given an extensive
        developer test set, the evaluator may be able to justify a low
        percentage sample.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        Where the developer has used an automated test suite to
        perform functional testing, it will usually be easier for the
        evaluator to re-run the entire test suite rather than repeat
        only a sample of developer tests. However the evaluator does
        have an obligation to check that the automatic testing does
        not give misrepresentative results. The implication is thus
        that this check must be performed for a sample of the
        automatic test suite, with the principles for selecting some
        tests in preference to others and ensuring a sufficient sample
        size applying equally in this case.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        The following principles should be followed whenever sampling
        is performed:
        <list type="enumerated">
          <item>
            Sampling should not be random, rather it should be chosen
            such that it is representative of all of the evidence. The
            sample size and composition must always be justified.
          </item>
          <item>
            When sampling relates to the correct implementation of the
            TOE, the sample should be representative of all aspects
            relevant to the areas that are sampled. In particular, the
            selection should cover a variety of components,
            interfaces, developer and operational sites (if more than
            one is involved) and hardware platform types (if more than
            one is involved). The sample size should be commensurate
            with the cost effectiveness of the evaluation and will
            depend on a number of TOE dependent factors (e.g. the size
            and complexity of the TOE, the amount of documentation).
          </item>
          <item>
            Also, when sampling relates to specifically gaining
            evidence that the developer testing is repeatable and
            reproducible the sample used must be sufficient to
            represent all distinct aspects of developer testing, such
            as different test regimes.  The sample used must be
            sufficient to detect any systematic problem in the
            developer's functional testing process. The evaluator
            contribution resulting from the combination of repeating
            developer tests and performing independent tests must be
            sufficient to address the major points of concern for the
            TOE.
          </item>
          <item>
            Where sampling relates to gaining evidence that a process
            (e.g. visitor control or design review) the evaluator
            should sample sufficient information to gain reasonable
            confidence that the procedure is being followed.
          </item>
          <item>
            The sponsor and developer should not be informed in
            advance of the exact composition of the sample, subject to
            ensuring timely delivery of the sample and supporting
            deliverable, e.g. test harnesses and equipment to the
            evaluator in accordance with the evaluation schedule.
          </item>
          <item>
            The choice of the sample should be free from bias to the
            degree possible (one should not always choose the first or
            last item). Ideally the sample selection should be done by
            someone other than the evaluator.
          </item>
        </list></para>
      <para type="normal">
        Errors found in the sample can be categorised as being either
        systematic or sporadic. If the error is systematic, the
        problem should be corrected and a complete new sample
        taken. If properly explained, sporadic errors might be solved
        without the need for a new sample, although the explanation
        should be confirmed. The evaluator should use judgement in
        determining whether to increase the sample size or use a
        different sample.</para>

        In general it is possible to perform the required evaluation
        activities, sub-activities, and actions in any order or in
        parallel. However, there are different kinds of dependencies

          or even require a sequence for the related activities. A
          specific instance is the ST activity. The ST evaluation
          activity is started prior to any TOE evaluation activities
          since the ST provides the basis and context to perform
          them. However, a final verdict on the ST evaluation may not
          be possible until the TOE evaluation is complete, since
          changes to the ST may result from activity findings during

          Dependencies identified between components in CC Part 3 have
          to be considered by the evaluator.  Most dependencies are
          one way, e.g. <xref id="ava_van.1" show="link"/> claims a
          dependency on <xref id="adv_fsp.1" show="link"/> and <xref id="agd_ope.1" show="link"/>. There are also instances of
          mutual dependencies, where both components depend on each
          other.  An example of this is <xref id="ate_fun.1" show="link"/> and <xref id="ate_cov.1" show="link"/>.</para>
        <para id="pgfId-715292" type="normal">
          A sub-activity can be assigned a pass verdict normally only
          if all those sub-activities are successfully completed on
          which it has a one-way dependency. For example, a pass
          verdict on <xref id="ava_van.1" show="link"/> can normally
          only be assigned if the sub-activities related to <xref id="adv_fsp.1" show="link"/> and <xref id="agd_ope.1" show="link"/> are assigned a pass verdict too. In the case
          of mutual dependency the ordering of these components is
          down to the evaluator deciding which sub-activity to perform
          first.  Note this indicates that pass verdicts can normally
          only be assigned once both sub-activities have been
          successful.</para>
        <para id="pgfId-715293" type="normal">
          So when determining whether a sub-activity will impact
          another sub-activity, the evaluator should consider whether
          this activity depends on potential evaluation results from
          any dependent sub-activities. Indeed, it may be the case
          that a dependent sub-activity will impact this sub-activity,
          requiring previously completed evaluator actions to be
          performed again.</para>
        <para id="pgfId-715294" type="normal">
          A significant dependency effect occurs in the case of
          evaluator-detected flaws. If a flaw is identified as a
          result of conducting one sub-activity, the assignment of a
          pass verdict to a dependent sub-activity may not be possible

          During an evaluation it is often necessary that the
          evaluator will meet the developer more than once and it is a
          question of good planning to combine the site visit with
          another meeting to reduce costs. For example one might
          combine the site visits for configuration management, for
          the developer's security and for delivery. It may also be
          necessary to perform more than one site visit to the same
          site to allow the checking of all development phases. It
          should be considered that development could occur at
          multiple facilities within a single building, multiple
          buildings at the same site, or at multiple sites.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          The first site visit should be scheduled early during the
          evaluation. In the case of an evaluation which starts during
          the development phase of the TOE, this will allow corrective
          actions to be taken, if necessary. In the case of an
          evaluation which starts after the development of the TOE, an
          early site visit could allow corrective measures to be put

      Interviews are also a useful means of determining whether the

      used in practise and whether they are being applied as described

    Those portions of a TOE that must be relied on for the correct
    enforcement of the SFRs are collectively referred to as the
    <bold>TOE Security Functionality (TSF)</bold>. The TSF consists of
    all hardware, software, and firmware of a TOE that is either
    directly or indirectly relied upon for security enforcement.</para>
  <para type="normal">
    The TOE may be a monolithic product containing hardware, firmware,
    and software.</para>
  <para type="normal">
    Alternatively a TOE may be a distributed product that consists
    internally of multiple separated parts. Each of these parts of the
    TOE provides a particular service for the TOE, and is connected to
    the other parts of the TOE through an <bold>internal communication
    channel</bold>. This channel can be as small as a processor bus,
    or may encompass a network internal to the TOE.</para>
  <para type="normal">
    When the TOE consists of multiple parts, each part of the TOE may
    have its own part of the TSF which exchanges user and TSF data
    over internal communication channels with other parts of the
    TSF. This interaction is called <bold>internal TOE
    transfer</bold>. In this case the separate parts of the TSF
    abstractly form the composite TSF, which enforces the SFRs.</para>
  <para type="normal">
    TOE interfaces may be localised to the particular TOE, or they may
    allow interaction with other IT products over <bold>external
    communication channels</bold>. These external interactions with
    other IT products may take two forms:
    <list type="enumerated">
      <item>
        The SFRs of the other ``trusted IT product'' and the SFRs of
        the TOE have been administratively coordinated and the other
        trusted IT product is assumed to enforce its SFRs correctly
        (e. g. by being separately evaluated). Exchanges of
        information in this situation are called <bold>inter-TSF
        transfers</bold>, as they are between the TSFs of distinct
        trusted products.
      </item>
      <item>
        The other IT product may not be trusted, it may be called an
        ``untrusted IT product''. Therefore its SFRs are either
        unknown or their implementation is not viewed as
        trustworthy. TSF mediated exchanges of information in this
        situation are called <bold>transfers outside of the
        TOE</bold>, as there is no TSF (or its policy characteristics
        are unknown) on the other IT product.
      </item>
    </list></para>
  <para type="normal"> The set of interfaces, whether interactive (man-machine
    interface) or programmatic (application programming interface),
    through which resources are accessed that are mediated by the TSF,
    or information is obtained from the TSF, is referred to as the
    <bold>TSF Interface (TSFI)</bold>. The TSFI defines the boundaries
    of the TOE functionality that provide for the enforcement of the
    SFRs.</para>
  <para type="normal">
      Users are outside of the TOE. However, in order to request that
      services be performed by the TOE that are subject to rules
      defined in the SFRs, users interact with the TOE through the
      TSFIs. There are two types of users of interest to CC Part 2:
      <bold>human users</bold> and <bold>external IT
      entities</bold>. Human users may further be differentiated as
      <bold>local human users</bold>, meaning they interact directly
      with the TOE via TOE devices (e.g.  workstations), or
      <bold>remote human users</bold>, meaning they interact
      indirectly with the TOE through another IT product.</para>
  <para type="normal">
    A period of interaction between users and the TSF is referred to
    as a user <bold>session</bold>. Establishment of user sessions can
    be controlled based on a variety of considerations, for example:
    user authentication, time of day, method of accessing the TOE, and
    number of allowed concurrent sessions (per user or in total).</para>
  <para type="normal">
    This part of the CC uses the term <bold>authorised</bold> to
    signify a user who possesses the rights and/or privileges
    necessary to perform an operation. The term <bold>authorised
    user</bold>, therefore, indicates that it is allowable for a user
    to perform a specific operation or a set of operations as defined
    by the SFRs.</para>
  <para type="normal">
      To express requirements that call for the separation of
      administrator duties, the relevant security functional
      components (from family <xref id="fmt_smr" show="id"/>)
      explicitly state that administrative <bold>roles</bold> are
      required. A role is a pre-defined set of rules establishing the
      allowed interactions between a user operating in that role and
      the TOE. A TOE may support the definition of any number of
      roles. For example, roles related to the secure operation of a
      TOE may include ``Audit Administrator'' and ``User Accounts
      Administrator''.</para>
  <para type="normal">
    TOEs contain <bold>resources</bold> that may be used for the
    processing and storing of information. The primary goal of the TSF
    is the complete and correct enforcement of the SFRs over the
    resources and information that the TOE controls.</para>
  <para type="normal">
    TOE resources can be structured and utilised in many different
    ways. However, CC Part 2 makes a specific distinction that allows
    for the specification of desired security properties. All entities
    that can be created from resources can be characterised in one of
    two ways. The entities may be active, meaning that they are the
    cause of actions that occur internal to the TOE and cause
    operations to be performed on information. Alternatively, the
    entities may be passive, meaning that they are either the
    container from which information originates or to which
    information is stored.</para>
  <para type="normal">
    Active entities in the TOE that perform operations on objects are
    referred to as <bold>subjects</bold>. Several types of subjects
    may exist within a TOE:
    <list type="enumerated">
      <item>
        those acting on behalf of an authorised user (e.g. UNIX
        processes);
      </item>
      <item>
        those acting as a specific functional process that may in turn
        act on behalf of multiple users (e.g. functions as might be
        found in client/server architectures); or
      </item>
      <item>
        those acting as part of the TOE itself (e.g. processes not
        acting on behalf of a user).
      </item>
    </list></para>
  <para type="normal">
    CC Part 2 addresses the enforcement of the SFRs over types of
    subjects as those listed above.</para>
  <para type="normal">
    Passive entities in the TOE that contain or receive information
    and upon which subjects perform operations are called
    <bold>objects</bold>. In the case where a subject (an active
    entity) is the target of an operation (e.g. interprocess
    communication), a subject may also be acted on as an object.</para>
  <para type="normal">
    Objects can contain <bold>information</bold>. This concept is
    required to specify information flow control policies as addressed
    in the FDP class.</para>
  <para type="normal">
    Users, subjects, information, objects, sessions and resources
    controlled by rules in the SFRs may possess certain
    <bold>attributes</bold> that contain information that is used by
    the TOE for its correct operation. Some attributes, such as file
    names, may be intended to be informational or may be used to
    identify individual resources while others, such as access control
    information, may exist specifically for the enforcement of the
    SFRs. These latter attributes are generally referred to as
    ``<bold>security attributes</bold>''. The word attribute will be
    used as a shorthand in some places of this part of the CC for the
    word ``security attribute''. However, no matter what the intended
    purpose of the attribute information, it may be necessary to have
    controls on attributes as dictated by the SFRs.</para>
  <para type="normal">
    Data in a TOE is categorised as either user data or TSF
    data. Figure <xref id="figusertsfdata" show="link"/> depicts this
    relationship. <bold>User Data</bold> is information stored in TOE
    resources that can be operated upon by users in accordance with
    the SFRs and upon which the TSF places no special meaning. For
    example, the content of an electronic mail message is user
    data. TSF Data is information used by the TSF in making decisions
    as required by the SFRs. <bold>TSF Data</bold> may be influenced
    by users if allowed by the SFRs. Security attributes,
    authentication data, TSF internal status variables used by the
    rules defined in the SFRs or used for the protection of the TSF
    and access control list entries are examples of TSF data.</para>
  <para type="normal">
    There are several SFPs that apply to data protection such as
    <bold>access control SFPs</bold> and <bold>information flow
    control SFPs</bold>. The mechanisms that implement access control
    SFPs base their policy decisions on attributes of the users,
    resources, subjects, objects, sessions, TSF status data and
    operations within the scope of control. These attributes are used
    in the set of rules that govern operations that subjects may
    perform on objects.</para>
  <para type="normal">
    The mechanisms that implement information flow control SFPs base
    their policy decisions on the attributes of the subjects and
    information within the scope of control and the set of rules that
    govern the operations by subjects on information. The attributes
    of the information, which may be associated with the attributes of
    the container or may be derived from the data in the container,
    stay with the information as it is processed by the TSF.</para>
  <figure entity="clause/graphics/part201-3.png" width="8cm" height="!" title="Relationship between user data and TSF data" id="figusertsfdata"/>
  <para type="normal">
    Two specific types of TSF data addressed by CC Part 2 can be, but
    are not necessarily, the same. These are <bold>authentication
    data</bold> and <bold>secrets</bold>.</para>
  <para type="normal">
    Authentication data is used to verify the claimed identity of a
    user requesting services from a TOE. The most common form of
    authentication data is the password, which depends on being kept
    secret in order to be an effective security mechanism. However,
    not all forms of authentication data need to be kept
    secret. Biometric authentication devices (e.g. fingerprint
    readers, retinal scanners) do not rely on the fact that the data
    is kept secret, but rather that the data is something that only
    one user possesses and that cannot be forged.</para>
  <para type="normal">
      The term secrets, as used in CC Part 2, while applicable to
      authentication data, is intended to also be applicable to other
      types of data that must be kept secret in order to enforce a
      specific SFP. For example, a trusted channel mechanism that
      relies on cryptography to preserve the confidentiality of
      information being transmitted via the channel can only be as
      strong as the method used to keep the cryptographic keys secret
      from unauthorised disclosure.</para>
  <para type="normal">
    Therefore, some, but not all, authentication data needs to be kept
    secret and some, but not all, secrets are used as authentication
    data. Figure <xref id="figauthdata" show="link"/> shows this relationship
    between secrets and authentication data. In the Figure the types
    of data typically encountered in the authentication data and the
    secrets sections are indicated.</para>

        In contrast to the evaluation sub-activities, input and output

          The sponsor is responsible for requesting and supporting an
          evaluation. This means that the sponsor establishes the

          the evaluation). Moreover, the sponsor is responsible for

          and <xref id="alc_del" show="link"/>) will also apply to the

          It is recommended that the evaluator, in conjunction with
          the sponsor, produce an index to required evaluation
          evidence. This index may be a set of references to the
          documentation. This index should contain enough information
          (e.g. a brief summary of each document, or at least an
          explicit title, indication of the subclauses of interest) to
          help the evaluator to find easily the required
          evidence.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          It is the information contained in the evaluation evidence
          that is required, not any particular document
          structure. Evaluation evidence for a sub-activity may be
          provided by separate documents, or a single document may
          satisfy several of the input requirements of a
          sub-activity.</para>

          The evaluator requires stable and formally-issued versions
          of evaluation evidence. However, draft evaluation evidence
          may be provided during an evaluation, for example, to help
          an evaluator make an early, informal assessment, but is not
          used as the basis for verdicts. It may be helpful for the
          evaluator to see draft versions of particular appropriate
          evaluation evidence, such as:
          <list type="enumerated">
            <item>
              test documentation, to allow the evaluator to make an

            </item>
            <item>
              design documents, to provide the evaluator with
              background for understanding the TOE design;

          the evaluation of an already-developed TOE where the
          developer has had to perform additional work to address a
          problem identified by the evaluator (e.g. to correct an
          error in design or implementation) or to provide evaluation
          evidence of security that is not provided in the existing

      The CC permits comparability between the results of independent
      security evaluations. The CC does so by providing a common set
      of requirements for the security functionality of IT products
      and for assurance measures applied to these IT products during a
      security evaluation. These IT products may be implemented in
      hardware, firmware or software.</para><para type="normal">
      The evaluation process establishes a level of confidence that
      the security functionality of these IT products and the
      assurance measures applied to these IT products meet these
      requirements. The evaluation results may help consumers to
      determine whether these IT products fulfil their security needs.</para><para type="normal">
      The CC is useful as a guide for the development, evaluation
      and/or procurement of IT products with security functionality.</para><para type="normal">
      The CC is intentionally flexible, enabling a range of evaluation
      methods to be applied to a range of security properties of a
      range of IT products. Therefore users of the standard are
      cautioned to exercise care that this flexibility is not
      misused. For example, using the CC in conjunction with
      unsuitable evaluation methods, irrelevant security properties,
      or inappropriate IT products, may result in meaningless
      evaluation results.</para><para type="normal">
      Consequently, the fact that an IT product has been evaluated has
      meaning only in the context of the security properties that were
      evaluated and the evaluation methods that were used. Evaluation
      authorities are advised to carefully check the products,
      properties and methods to determine that an evaluation will
      provide meaningful results. Additionally, purchasers of
      evaluated products are advised to carefully consider this
      context to determine whether the evaluated product is useful and
      applicable to their specific situation and needs.</para><para type="normal">
      The CC addresses protection of assets from unauthorised
      disclosure, modification, or loss of use. The categories of
      protection relating to these three types of failure of security
      are commonly called confidentiality, integrity, and
      availability, respectively. The CC may also be applicable
      to aspects of IT security outside of these three. The CC
      is applicable to risks arising from human activities (malicious
      or otherwise) and to risks arising from non-human
      activities. Apart from IT security, the CC may be applied
      in other areas of IT, but makes no claim of applicability in
      these areas.</para><para type="normal">
      Certain topics, because they involve specialised techniques or
      because they are somewhat peripheral to IT security, are
      considered to be outside the scope of the CC. Some of these are
      identified below.
      <list type="enumerated"><item>
          The CC does not contain security evaluation criteria
          pertaining to administrative security measures not related
          directly to the IT security functionality. However, it is
          recognised that significant security can often be achieved
          through or supported by administrative measures such as
          organisational, personnel, physical, and procedural
          controls.
        </item><item>
          The evaluation of some technical physical aspects of IT
          security such as electromagnetic emanation control is not
          specifically covered, although many of the concepts
          addressed will be applicable to that area.
        </item><item>
          The CC does not address the evaluation methodology
          under which the criteria should be applied. This methodology
          is given in the CEM.
        </item><item>
          The CC does not address the administrative and legal
          framework under which the criteria may be applied by
          evaluation authorities. However, it is expected that the CC
          will be used for evaluation purposes in the context of such
          a framework.
        </item><item>
          The procedures for use of evaluation results in
          accreditation are outside the scope of the CC. Accreditation
          is the administrative process whereby authority is granted
          for the operation of an IT product (or collection thereof)
          in its full operational environment including all of its
          non-IT parts. The results of the evaluation process are an
          input to the accreditation process. However, as other
          techniques are more appropriate for the assessments of
          non-IT related properties and their relationship to the IT
          security parts, accreditors should make separate provisions
          for those aspects.
        </item><item>
          The subject of criteria for the assessment of the inherent
          qualities of cryptographic algorithms is not covered in the
          CC. Should independent assessment of mathematical properties
          of cryptography be required, the evaluation scheme under
          which the CC is applied must make provision for such
          assessments.

          The PP and the ST may contain entirely different statements

          the ST author to claim conformance to these PPs
          simultaneously, thereby saving work.

          usually in the absence of any previous analysis having been
          performed. Compare with the terms ``confirm'' or

          This term is used in the CC with respect to conducting an
          analysis or other activity. It is related to ``systematic''
          but is considerably stronger, in that it indicates not only
          that a methodical approach has been taken to perform the
          analysis or activity according to an unambiguous plan, but
          that the plan that was followed is sufficient to ensure that

          This term differs from both ``describe'' and
          ``demonstrate''. It is intended to answer the question
          ``Why?'' without actually attempting to argue that the

            For example, variables that are placed into a global area,
            but are used by only a single module, are inappropriately
            placed, and should be removed. Other factors that need to
            be considered in assessing the suitability of global
            variables are:

                The number of modules that modify a global variable:
                In general, only a single module should be allocated
                the responsibility for controlling the contents of a
                global variable, but there may be situations in which
                a second module may share that responsibility; in such
                a case, sufficient justification must be provided. It
                is unacceptable for this responsibility to be shared
                by more than two modules. (In making this assessment,
                care should be given to determining the module
                actually responsible for the contents of the variable;
                for example, if a single routine is used to modify the
                variable, but that routine simply performs the
                modification requested by its caller, it is the
                calling module that is responsible, and there may be
                more than one such module). Further, as part of the
                complexity determination, if two modules are
                responsible for the contents of a global variable,
                there should be clear indications of how the
                modifications are coordinated between them.

                cases in which many modules make such a reference

          description of how the configuration management system is
          used for the TOE
        </glossdef><glossnote>
          The objective of issuing a configuration management plan is
          that staff members can see clearly what they have to
          do. From the point of view of the overall configuration
          management system this can be seen as an output document
          (because it may be produced as part of the application of
          the configuration management system). From the point of view
          of the concrete project it is a usage document because
          members of the project team use it in order to understand
          the steps that they have to perform during the project. The
          configuration management plan defines the usage of the
          system for the specific product; the same system may be used
          to a different extent for other products. That means the
          configuration management plan defines and describes the
          output of the configuration management system of a company
          which is used during the TOE development.

          Configuration management systems may have varying degrees of

      This Clause introduces the main concepts of the CC. It
      identifies the concept ``TOE'', the target audience of the CC,
      and the approach taken to present the material in the remainder
      of the CC.</para><subclause title="The TOE" id="overview-products-toes"><para type="normal">
        The CC is flexible in what to evaluate and is therefore not
        tied to the boundaries of IT products as commonly
        understood. Therefore in the context of evaluation, the CC
        uses the term ``TOE'' (Target of Evaluation).</para><para type="normal">
        A TOE is defined as a set of software, firmware and/or
        hardware possibly accompanied by guidance.</para><para type="normal">
        While there are cases where a TOE consists of an IT product,
        this need not be the case. The TOE may be an IT product, a
        part of an IT product, a set of IT products, a unique
        technology that may never be made into a product, or a
        combination of these.</para><para type="normal">
        As far as the CC is concerned, the precise relation
        between the TOE and any IT products is only important in one
        aspect: the evaluation of a TOE containing only part of an IT
        product should not be misrepresented as the evaluation of the
        entire IT product.</para><para type="normal">
        Examples of TOEs include: 
      <list type="itemized"><item>
            A software application; 
          </item><item>
            An operating system;

          </item></list></para><subclause title="Different representations of the TOE" id="diff-reps-TOE"><para type="normal">
          In the CC, a TOE can occur in several
          representations, such as (for a software TOE): 
          <list type="itemized"><item>
              a list of files in a configuration management system;
            </item><item>
              a single master copy, that has just been compiled;
            </item><item>
              a box containing a CD-ROM and a manual, ready to be shipped to a customer;
            </item><item>
              an installed and operational version.
            </item></list></para><para type="normal">
          All of these are considered to be a TOE: and wherever the
          term ``TOE'' is used in the remainder of the CC, the
          context determines the representation that is meant.</para></subclause><subclause title="Different configurations of the TOE" id="diff-confs-TOE"><para type="normal">
          In general, IT products can be configured in many ways:
          installed in different ways, with different options enabled
          or disabled. As, during a CC evaluation, it will be
          determined whether a TOE meets certain requirements, this
          flexibility in configuration may lead to problems, as all
          possible configurations of the TOE must meet the
          requirements. For these reasons, it is often the case that
          the guidance part of the TOE strongly constrains the
          possible configurations of the TOE. That is: the guidance of
          the TOE may be different from the general guidance of the IT
          product.</para><para type="normal">
          An example is an operating system IT product. This product
          can be configured in many ways (e.g. types of users, number
          of users, types of external connections allowed/disallowed,
          options enabled/disabled etc.).</para><para type="normal">
          If the same IT product is to be a TOE, and is evaluated
          against a reasonable set of requirements, the configuration
          should be much more tightly controlled, as many options
          (e.g. allow all types of external connections or the system
          administrator does not need to be authenticated) will lead
          to a TOE not meeting the requirements.</para><para type="normal">
          For this reason, there would normally be a difference
          between the guidance of the IT product (allowing many
          configurations) and the guidance of the TOE (allowing only
          one or only configurations that do not differ in
          security-relevant ways).</para><para type="normal">
          Note that if the guidance of the TOE still allows more than
          one configuration, these configurations are collectively
          called ``the TOE'' and each such configuration must meet the
          requirements levied on the TOE.</para></subclause></subclause><subclause title="Target audience of the CC" id="Overview-Target-audience-of-the-CC"><para type="normal">
        There are three groups with a general interest in evaluation
        of the security properties of TOEs: consumers, developers and
        evaluators. The criteria presented in this CC part 1 have been
        structured to support the needs of all three groups. They are
        all considered to be the principal users of the CC. The
        three groups can benefit from the criteria as explained in the
        following paragraphs.</para><subclause title="Consumers" id="Overview-Consumers"><para type="normal">
          The CC is written to ensure that evaluation fulfils
          the needs of the consumers as this is the fundamental
          purpose and justification for the evaluation process.</para><para type="normal">
          Consumers can use the results of evaluations to help decide
          whether a TOE fulfils their security needs. These security
          needs are typically identified as a result of both risk
          analysis and policy direction. Consumers can also use the
          evaluation results to compare different TOEs.</para><para type="normal">
          The CC gives consumers, especially in consumer groups
          and communities of interest, an implementation-independent
          structure, termed the Protection Profile (PP), in which to
          express their security requirements in an unambiguous
          manner.</para></subclause><subclause title="Developers" id="Overview-Developers"><para type="normal">
          The CC is intended to support developers in preparing
          for and assisting in the evaluation of their TOEs and in
          identifying security requirements to be satisfied by those
          TOEs. These requirements are contained in an
          implementation-dependent construct termed the Security
          Target (ST). This ST may be based on one or more PPs to show
          that the ST conforms to the security requirements from
          consumers as laid down in those PPs.</para><para type="normal">
          The CC can then be used to determine the
          responsibilities and actions to provide evidence that is
          necessary to support the evaluation of the TOE against these
          requirements. It also defines the content and presentation
          of that evidence.</para></subclause><subclause title="Evaluators" id="Overview-Evaluators"><para type="normal">
          The CC contains criteria to be used by evaluators
          when forming judgements about the conformance of TOEs to
          their security requirements. The CC describes the set
          of general actions the evaluator is to carry out. Note that
          the CC does not specify procedures to be followed in
          carrying out those actions. More information on these
          procedures may be found in Subclause <xref show="link" id="Overview-Evaluation-context"/>.</para></subclause><subclause title="Others" id="Overview-Others"><para type="normal">
          While the CC is oriented towards specification and
          evaluation of the IT security properties of TOEs, it may
          also be useful as reference material to all parties with an
          interest in or responsibility for IT security. Some of the
          additional interest groups that can benefit from information
          contained in the CC are:

            assurance components and organises them into families and
            classes. CC Part 3 also defines evaluation criteria for
            PPs and STs and presents seven pre-defined assurance

        In order to achieve greater comparability between evaluation
        results, evaluations should be performed within the framework
        of an authoritative evaluation scheme that sets the standards,
        monitors the quality of the evaluations and administers the
        regulations to which the evaluation facilities and evaluators
        must conform.</para><para type="normal">
        The CC does not state requirements for the regulatory
        framework. However, consistency between the regulatory

        results of such evaluations.</para><para type="normal">
        A second way of achieving greater comparability between

        Use of a common evaluation methodology contributes to the

      This clause presents the general concepts used throughout the

      and the CC approach for applying the concepts. CC Part 2 and CC
      Part 3, which are obliged to be consulted by users of the CC
      Part 1, expand on the use of these concepts and assume that the
      approach described is used. Further, for users of the CC who

      applicable. This clause assumes some knowledge of IT security
      and does not propose to act as a tutorial in this area.</para><para type="normal">
      The CC discusses security using a set of security
      concepts and terminology. An understanding of these concepts and
      the terminology is a prerequisite to the effective use of
      the CC. However, the concepts themselves are quite
      general and are not intended to restrict the class of IT
      security problems to which the CC is applicable.</para><subclause title="Assets and countermeasures" id="general-assets-counterm"><para type="normal">
        Security is concerned with the protection of assets. Assets
        are entities that someone places value upon. Examples of
        assets include:
        <list type="itemized"><item>contents of a file or a server;</item><item>the authenticity of votes cast in an election;</item><item>the availability of an electronic commerce

        The environment(s) in which these assets are located is called

            the computer room of a bank;

        Many assets are in the form of information that is stored,
        processed and transmitted by IT products to meet requirements
        laid down by owners of the information. Information owners may
        require that availability, dissemination and modification of
        any such information are strictly controlled and that the
        assets are protected from threats by countermeasures. Figure

        Safeguarding assets of interest is the responsibility of
        owners who place value on those assets. Actual or presumed
        threat agents may also place value on the assets and seek to
        abuse assets in a manner contrary to the interests of the
        owner. Examples of threat agents include hackers, malicious
        users, non-malicious users (who sometimes make errors),
        computer processes and accidents.</para><para type="normal">
        The owners of the assets will perceive such threats as
        potential for impairment of the assets such that the value of
        the assets to the owners would be reduced. Security-specific
        impairment commonly includes, but is not limited to: loss of
        asset confidentiality, loss of asset integrity and loss of
        asset availability.</para><para type="normal">
        These threats therefore give rise to risks to the assets,
        based on the likelihood of a threat being realised and the
        impact on the assets when that threat is
        realised. Subsequently countermeasures are imposed to reduce
        the risks to assets. These countermeasures may consist of IT
        countermeasures (such as firewalls and smart cards) and non-IT
        countermeasures (such as guards and procedures). See also
        ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 for a more general discussion

          The Security Target begins with describing the assets and
          the threats to those assets. The Security Target then
          describes the countermeasures (in the form of Security
          Objectives) and demonstrates that these countermeasures are
          sufficient to counter these threats: if the countermeasures
          do what they claim to do, the threats are countered.</para><para type="normal">
          The Security Target then divides these countermeasures in
          two groups:
          <list type="enumerated"><item>
              the security objectives for the TOE: these describe the
              countermeasure(s) for which correctness will be
              determined in the evaluation;
            </item><item>
              the security objectives for the Operational Environment:
              these describe the countermeasures for which correctness
              will not be determined in the evaluation.
            </item></list></para><para type="normal">
          The reasons for this division are: 
          <list type="itemized"><item>
              The CC is only suitable for assessing the
              correctness of IT countermeasures. Therefore the non-IT
              countermeasures (e.g. human security guards, procedures)
              are always in the Operational Environment.
            </item><item>
              Assessing correctness of countermeasures costs time and
              money, possibly making it infeasible to assess the
              correctness of all IT countermeasures.
            </item><item>
              The correctness of some IT countermeasures may already
              have been assessed in another evaluation. It is
              therefore not cost-effective to assess this correctness
              again.
            </item></list></para><para type="normal">
          For the TOE (the IT countermeasures whose correctness will
          be assessed during the evaluation), the Security Target
          requires a further detailing of the security objectives for
          the TOE in Security Functional Requirements (SFRs). These
          SFRs are formulated in a standardised language (described in
          CC Part 2) to ensure exactness and facilitate comparability.</para><para type="normal">
          In summary, the Security Target demonstrates that: 
          <list type="itemized"><item>
              The SFRs meet the security objectives for the TOE;
            </item><item>
              The security objectives for the TOE and the security
              objectives for the operational environment counter the
              threats;
            </item><item>
              And therefore, the SFRs and the security objectives for
              the operational environment counter the threats.
            </item></list></para><para type="normal">
          From this it follows that a correct TOE (meeting the SFRs)
          in combination with a correct operational environment
          (meeting the security objectives for the operational
          environment) will counter the threats. In the next two
          subclauses correctness of the TOE and correctness of the
          operational environment are discussed separately.</para></subclause><subclause title="Correctness of the TOE" id="correctness-toe"><para type="normal">
          A TOE may be incorrectly designed and implemented, and may
          therefore contain errors that lead to vulnerabilities. By
          exploiting these vulnerabilities, attackers may still damage
          and/or abuse the assets.</para><para type="normal">
          These vulnerabilities may arise from accidental errors made
          during development, poor design, intentional addition of
          malicious code, poor testing etc.</para><para type="normal">
          To determine correctness of the TOE, various activities can
          be performed such as:
          <list type="itemized"><item>
              testing the TOE;
            </item><item>
              examining various design representations of the TOE;
            </item><item>
              examining the physical security of the development
              environment of the TOE.
            </item></list></para><para type="normal">
          The Security Target provides a structured description of
          these activities to determine correctness in the form of
          Security Assurance Requirements (SARs). These SARs are
          formulated in a standardised language (described in CC Part
          3) to ensure exactness and facilitate comparability.</para><para type="normal">
          If the SARs are met, there exists assurance in the
          correctness of the TOE and the TOE is therefore less likely
          to contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by
          attackers. The amount of assurance that exists in the
          correctness of the TOE is determined by the SARs themselves:
          a few ``weak'' SARs will lead to a little assurance, a lot
          of ``strong'' SARs will lead to a lot of assurance.</para></subclause><subclause title="Correctness of the Operational Environment" id="correctness-operenv"><para type="normal">
          The operational environment may also be incorrectly designed

          to vulnerabilities. By exploiting these vulnerabilities,
          attackers may still damage and/or abuse the assets.</para><para type="normal">
          However, in the CC, no assurance is obtained
          regarding the correctness of the operational
          environment. Or, in other words, the operational environment
          is not evaluated (see the next Subclause).</para><para type="normal">
          As far as the evaluation is concerned, the operational
          environment is assumed to be a 100% correct instantiation of
          the security objectives for the operational environment.</para><para type="normal">
          This does not preclude a consumer of the TOE from using
          other methods to determine the correctness of his
          operational environment, such as:
          <list type="itemized"><item>

        dependencies should be satisfied when requirements based on

        packages.</para><para type="normal">
        In other words: if component A has a dependency on component
        B, this means that whenever a PP/ST contains a security

        one of :

        In both cases the PP/ST author is required to define his own

        as the other SFRs and SARs. From this point on, there is no
        further distinction between SARs and SFRs based on the CC and

        To allow consumer groups and communities of interest to

          A typical ST fulfils two roles: 
          <list type="itemized"><item>
              Before and during the evaluation, the ST specifies
              ``what is to be evaluated''. In this role, the ST serves
              as a basis for agreement between the developer and the
              evaluator on the exact security properties of the TOE
              and the exact scope of the evaluation. Technical
              correctness and completeness are major issues for this
              role. Subclause <xref id="st-sec-objs" show="link"/> describes how
              the ST should be used in this role.
            </item><item>
              After the evaluation, the ST specifies ``what was
              evaluated''. In this role, the ST serves as a basis for
              agreement between the developer or re-seller of the TOE
              and the potential consumer of the TOE. The ST describes
              the exact security properties of the TOE in an abstract
              manner, and the potential consumer can rely on this
              description because the TOE has been evaluated to meet
              the ST. Ease of use and understandability are major
              issues for this role. Subclause <xref id="questions-st" show="link"/> describes how the ST should be used

          Two roles (among many) that an ST should not fulfil are:

              high level of abstraction. An ST should, in general, not
              contain detailed protocol specifications, detailed
              descriptions of algorithms and/or mechanisms, long
              description of detailed operations etc.

              weight, required voltage etc. should not be part of an
              ST. This means that in general an ST may be a part of a

          An ST contains a clear ST reference that identifies that
          particular ST. A typical ST reference consists of title,
          version, authors and publication date. An example of an ST
          reference is ``MauveRAM Database ST, version 1.3, MauveCorp
          Specification Team, 11 October 2002''.</para><para type="normal">
          An ST also contains a TOE reference that identifies the TOE
          that claims conformance to the ST. A typical TOE reference

          number. An example of a TOE reference is ``MauveCorp
          MauveRAM Database v2.11''. As a single TOE may be evaluated

          necessarily unique.</para><para type="normal">

          products, it is allowed to reflect this in the TOE

          this should not be used to mislead consumers: situations

          find TOEs that may meet their security needs, and are
          supported by their hardware, software and firmware. The
          typical length of a TOE overview is several paragraphs.</para><para type="normal">
          To this end, the TOE overview briefly describes the usage of

            The description of the usage and major security features
            of the TOE is intended to give a very general idea of what
            the TOE is capable of in terms of security, and what it
            can be used for in a security context. This subclause
            should be written for (potential) TOE consumers,

            of business operations, using language that TOE consumers
            understand.</para><para type="normal">
            An example of this is ``The MauveCorp MauveRAM Database

          These two groups are discussed in the following two subclauses:</para><subclause title="Security functional requirements (SFRs)" id="sec-req-SFRs"><para type="normal">
            The SFRs are a translation of the security objectives for
            the TOE. They are usually at a more detailed level of
            abstraction, but they have to be a complete translation
            (the security objectives must be completely addressed) and
            be independent of any specific technical solution
            (implementation). The CC requires this translation into a
            standardised language for several reasons:
            <list type="itemized"><item>
                to provide an exact description of what is to be
                evaluated. As security objectives for the TOE are
                usually formulated in natural language, translation
                into a standardised language enforces a more exact
                description of the functionality of the TOE.
              </item><item>
                to allow comparison between two STs. As different ST
                authors may use different terminology in describing
                their security objectives, the standardised language
                enforces using the same terminology and concepts. This
                allows easy comparison.
              </item></list></para><para type="normal">
            There is no translation required in the CC for the
            security objectives for the operational environment,
            because the operational environment is not evaluated and
            does therefore not require a description aimed at its
            evaluation. See the bibliography for items relevant to the
            security assessment of operational systems.</para><para type="normal">
            It may be the case that parts of the operational
            environment are evaluated in another evaluation, but this
            is out of scope for the current evaluation. For example:
            an OS TOE may require a firewall to be present in its
            operational environment. Another evaluation may
            subsequently evaluate the firewall, but this evaluation
            has nothing to do with the evaluation of the OS TOE.</para><subclause title="How the CC supports this translation" id="well-defined-trans"><para type="normal">
              The CC supports this translation in three ways: 
              <list type="enumerated"><item>
                  by providing a predefined precise ``language''
                  designed to describe exactly what is to be
                  evaluated. This language is defined as a set of
                  components defined in CC Part 2. The use of this
                  language as a well-defined translation of the
                  security objectives for the TOE to SFRs is
                  mandatory, though some exceptions exist (see
                  Subclause <xref id="extended-components-mandatory" show="link"/>).
                </item><item>
                  by providing operations: mechanisms that allow the
                  ST writer to modify the SFRs to provide a more
                  accurate translation of the security objectives for
                  the TOE. This part of the CC defines the four
                  allowed operations: assignment, selection,
                  iteration, and refinement. These are described
                  further in Subclause <xref id="components-operations" show="link"/>.
                </item><item>
                  by providing dependencies: a mechanism that supports
                  a more complete translation to SFRs. In the CC Part
                  2 language, an SFR can have a dependency on other
                  SFRs. This signifies that if an ST uses that SFR, it
                  generally needs to use those other SFRs as
                  well. This makes it much harder for the ST writer to
                  overlook including necessary SFRs and thereby
                  improves the completeness of the ST. Dependencies
                  are described further in Subclause <xref id="components-dependencies" show="link"/>.

              The ST also contains a security requirements rationale,

                for the TOE.</para></subclause><subclause title="Providing a justification for the tracing" id="just-tracing"><para type="normal">
                The security requirements rationale demonstrates that

                particular security objective for the TOE are
                satisfied, that security objective for the TOE is
                achieved.</para><para type="normal">

          by including multiple requirements based on the same
          component. Each iteration of a component is different from
          all other iterations of that component, which is realised by

          external entities.</para><para type="normal">

          The second rule for a refinement given is that the
          refinement shall be related to the original component. For
          example, refining an audit component with an extra element
          on prevention of electromagnetic radiation is not allowed.</para><para type="normal">

          English grammar, or to make it more understandable to the
          reader. This change is not allowed to modify the meaning of
          the requirement in any way. Examples of editorial

        A PP is intended to be used as a ``template'' for an ST. That
        is: the PP describes a set of user needs, while an ST that
        conforms to that PP describes a TOE that satisfies those
        needs.</para><para type="normal">
        Note that it is also possible for a PP to be used as a
        template for another PP. That is PPs can claim conformance to
        other PPs. This case is completely similar to that of an ST
        vs. a PP. For clarity this Annex describes only the ST/PP
        case, but it holds also for the PP/PP case.</para><para type="normal">
        The CC does not allow any form of partial conformance, so if a
        PP is claimed, the PP or ST must fully conform to the
        referenced PP or PPs. There are however two types of
        conformance (``strict'' and demonstrable'') and the type of
        conformance allowed is determined by the PP. That is, the PP
        states (in the PP conformance statement, see subclause <xref id="ccl-pp" show="link"/>) what the allowed types of conformance for the ST
        are. This distinction between strict and demonstrable
        conformance is applicable to each PP to which an ST may claim
        conformance on an individual basis. This may mean that the ST
        conforms strictly to some PPs and demonstrably to other
        PPs. An ST is only allowed to conform to a PP in a
        demonstrable manner, if the PP explicitly allows this, whereas
        an ST can always conform with strict conformance to any PP.</para><para type="normal">
        Restating this in other words, an ST is only allowed to
        conform to a PP in a demonstrable manner, if the PP explicitly

        Conformance to a PP means that the PP or ST (and if an ST is
        of an evaluated product, the product as well) meets all
        requirements of that PP.</para><para type="normal">
        Published PPs will normally require demonstrable
        conformance. This means that STs claiming conformance with the
        PP must offer a solution to the generic security problem
        described in the PP, but can do so in any way that is
        equivalent or more restrictive to that described in the
        PP. ``Equivalent but more restrictive'' is defined at length
        within the CC, but in principle it means that the PP
        and ST may contain entirely different statements that discuss
        different entities, use different concepts etc., provided that
        overall the ST levies the same or more restrictions on the
        TOE, and the same or less restrictions on the operational
        environment of the TOE.</para></subclause><subclause title="Strict conformance" id="strict-conformance"><para type="normal">
        Strict conformance is oriented to the PP-author who requires
        evidence that the requirements in the PP are met, that the ST

        than the PP. In essence, the ST specifies that the TOE does at
        least the same as in the PP, while the operational environment
        does at most the same as in the PP.</para><para type="normal">
        A typical example of the use of strict conformance is in

      Security auditing involves recognising, recording, storing,
      and analysing information related to security relevant
      activities (i.e. activities controlled by the TSF). The
      resulting audit records can be examined to determine which
      security relevant activities took place and whom (which user)

      CC audit families allow PP/ST authors the ability to define
      requirements for monitoring user activities and, in some
      cases, detecting real, possible, or imminent violations of
      the enforcement of the SFRs. The TOE's security audit functions are
      defined to help monitor security-relevant events, and act as a
      deterrent against security violations. The requirements of the
      audit families refer to functions that include audit data
      protection, record format, and event selection, as well as
      analysis tools, violation alarms, and real-time analysis. The
      audit trail should be presented in human-readable format
      either directly (e.g. storing the audit trail in
      human-readable format) or indirectly (e.g. using audit
      reduction tools), or both.</para>
    <para type="normal" id="pgfId-852565">
      While developing the security audit requirements, the PP/ST
      author should take note of the inter-relationships among the
      audit families and components. The potential exists to specify
      a set of audit requirements that comply with the
      family/component dependencies lists, while at the same time
      resulting in a deficient audit function (e.g. an audit
      function that requires all security relevant events to be
      audited but without the selectivity to control them on any
      reasonable basis such as individual user or object).</para>

        The implementation of audit requirements for networks and
        other large systems may differ significantly from those
        needed for stand-alone systems. Larger, more complex and

        data to collect and how this should be managed, due to
        lowered feasibility of interpreting (or even storing) what

      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-852970">
        This family is presented in a manner that avoids a dependency
        on all components requiring audit support. Each component has
        an audit section developed in which the events to be audited
        for that functional area are listed. When the PP/ST author
        assembles the PP/ST, the items in the audit area are used to
        complete the variable in this component. Thus, the
        specification of what could be audited for a functional area
        is localised in that functional area.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-852971">
        The list of auditable events is entirely dependent on the
        other functional families within the PP/ST. Each family
        definition should therefore include a list of its
        family-specific auditable events. Each auditable event in the
        list of auditable events specified in the functional family
        should correspond to one of the levels of audit event
        generation specified in this family (i.e. minimal, basic,
        detailed). This provides the PP/ST author with information
        necessary to ensure that all appropriate auditable events are
        specified in the PP/ST. The following example shows how
        auditable events are to be specified in appropriate functional

        auditable. If, for example, in the previous example ``Basic''

        Minimal or Basic, should also be included in the PP/ST
        through the use of the appropriate assignment operation,

        detail than the lower level event. When Detailed Audit

        A PP/ST author may decide to include other auditable events
        beyond those required for a given audit level. For example,
        the PP/ST may claim only minimal audit capabilities while
        including most of the basic capabilities because the few
        excluded capabilities conflict with other PP/ST constraints

        This class provides two families specifically concerned with
        assuring the identity of a party participating in a data
        exchange. These families are related to assuring the identity
        of the originator of transmitted information (proof of origin)
        and assuring the identity of the recipient of transmitted
        information (proof of receipt). These families ensure that an
        originator cannot deny having sent the message, nor can the
        recipient deny having received it.</para>

        This class describes requirements specifically of interest for
        TOEs that are used for the transport of information. Families
        within this class deal with non-repudiation.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-4863">
        In this class the concept of ``information'' is
        used. This information should be interpreted as the object
        being communicated, and could contain an electronic mail
        message, a file, or a set of predefined attribute types.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-4692">
        In the literature, the terms ``proof of receipt''
        and ``proof of origin'' are commonly used
        terms. However it is recognised that the term
        ``proof'' might be interpreted in a legal sense to
        imply a form of mathematical rationale. The components in this
        class interpret the de-facto use of the word
        ``proof'' in the context of ``evidence''
        that the TSF demonstrates the non-repudiated transport of
        types of information.</para>

        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-3479">
          Non-repudiation of origin ensures that the originator of
          information cannot successfully deny having sent the
          information. This family requires that the TSF provide a
          method to ensure that a subject that receives information
          during a data exchange is provided with evidence of the
          origin of the information. This evidence can then be
          verified by either this subject or other subjects.</para>
      </ff-behaviour>
      <ff-user-notes>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-5710">
          Non-repudiation of origin defines requirements to provide
          evidence to users/subjects about the identity of the
          originator of some information. The originator cannot
          successfully deny having sent the information because
          evidence of origin (e.g. digital signature) provides
          evidence of the binding between the originator and the
          information sent. The recipient or a third party can verify
          the evidence of origin. This evidence should not be
          forgeable.</para>        
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-5155">
          If the information or the associated attributes are altered
          in any way, validation of the evidence of origin might
          fail. Therefore a PP/ST author should consider including
          integrity requirements such as <xref show="link" id="fdp_uit.1"/> in the
          PP/ST.</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-4414">
          In non-repudiation there are several different roles
          involved, each of which could be combined in one or more
          subjects. The first role is a subject that requests evidence
          of origin (only in <xref show="link" id="fco_nro.1"/>). The second role
          is the recipient and/or other subjects to which the evidence
          is provided (e.g. a notary). The third role is a subject
          that requests verification of the evidence of origin, for
          example, a recipient or a third party such as an arbiter.</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-4760">
          The PP/ST author must specify the conditions that must be
          met to be able to verify the validity of the evidence. An
          example of a condition which could be specified is where the
          verification of evidence must occur within 24 hours. These
          conditions, therefore, allow the tailoring of the
          non-repudiation to legal requirements, such as being able to
          provide evidence for several years.</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-4419">
          In most cases, the identity of the recipient will be the
          identity of the user who received the transmission. In some
          instances, the PP/ST author does not want the user identity
          to be exported. In that case the PP/ST author must consider
          whether it is appropriate to include this class, or whether
          the identity of the transport service provider or the
          identity of the host should be used.</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-4420">
          In addition to (or instead of) the user identity, a PP/ST
          author might be more concerned about the time the
          information was transmitted. For example, requests for
          proposals must be transmitted before a certain date in order
          to be considered. In such instances, these requirements can
          be customised to provide a timestamp indication (time of
          origin).</para>

          involved, each of which could be combined in one or more
          subjects. The first role is a subject that requests evidence
          of receipt (only in <xref show="link" id="fco_nrr.1"/>). The second role
          is the recipient and/or other subjects to which the evidence
          is provided, (e.g. a notary). The third role is a subject
          that requests verification of the evidence of receipt, for
          example, an originator or a third party such as an arbiter.</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-4514">
          The PP/ST author must specify the conditions that must be
          met to be able to verify the validity of the evidence. An
          example of a condition which could be specified is where the
          verification of evidence must occur within 24 hours. These
          conditions, therefore, allow the tailoring of the
          non-repudiation to legal requirements, such as being able to
          provide evidence for several years.</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-4515">
          In most cases, the identity of the recipient will be the
          identity of the user who received the transmission. In some
          instances, the PP/ST author does not want the user identity
          to be exported. In that case, the PP/ST author must consider
          whether it is appropriate to include this class, or whether
          the identity of the transport service provider or the
          identity of the host should be used.</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-4516">
          In addition to (or instead of) the user identity, a PP/ST
          author might be more concerned about the time the
          information was received. For example, when an offer expires
          at a certain date, orders must be received before a certain
          date in order to be considered. In such instances, these
          requirements can be customised to provide a timestamp
          indication (time of receipt).</para>

      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-805223">
        This class contains families specifying requirements related
        to protecting user data. This class differs from FIA and FPT
        in that <xref show="link" id="fdp"/> specifies components to
        protect user data, FIA specifies components to protect
        attributes associated with the user, and FPT specifies
        components to protect TSF information.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-806624">
        The class does not contain explicit requirements for
        traditional Mandatory Access Controls (MAC) or traditional
        Discretionary Access Controls (DAC); however, such
        requirements may be constructed using components from this
        class.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-797822">
        <xref show="link" id="fdp"/> does not explicitly deal with
        confidentiality, integrity, or availability, as all three are
        most often intertwined in the policy and mechanisms. However,
        the TOE security policy must adequately cover these three
        objectives in the PP/ST.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-797823">
        A final aspect of this class is that it specifies access
        control in terms of ``operations''. An operation
        is defined as a specific type of access on a specific
        object. It depends on the level of abstraction of the PP/ST
        author whether these operations are described as
        ``read'' and/or ``write''
        operations, or as more complex operations such as
        ``update the database''.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-806113">
        The access control policies are policies that control access
        to the information container. The attributes represent
        attributes of the container. Once the information is out of
        the container, the accessor is free to modify that
        information, including writing the information into a
        different container with different attributes. By contrast, an
        information flow policies controls access to the information,
        independent of the container. The attributes of the
        information, which may be associated with the attributes of
        the container (or may not, as in the case of a multi-level
        database) stay with the information as it moves. The accessor
        does not have the ability, in the absence of an explicit
        authorisation, to change the attributes of the information.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-806115">
        This class is not meant to be a complete taxonomy of IT access
        policies, as others can be imagined. Those policies included
        here are simply those for which current experience with actual
        systems provides a basis for specifying requirements. There
        may be other forms of intent that are not captured in the
        definitions here.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-803898">
        For example, one could imagine a goal of having user-imposed
        (and user-defined) controls on information flow (e.g. an
        automated implementation of the NO FOREIGN handling
        caveat). Such concepts could be handled as refinements of, or
        extensions to the <xref show="link" id="fdp"/> components.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-803899">
        Finally, it is important when looking at the components in
        <xref show="link" id="fdp"/> to remember that these components are
        requirements for functions that may be implemented by a
        mechanism that also serves or could serve another purpose. For
        example, it is possible to build an access control policy
        (<xref show="link" id="fdp_acc"/>) that uses labels (<xref show="link" id="fdp_iff.1"/>) as the basis of the access control
        mechanism.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-801583">
        A set of SFRs may encompass many security function
        policies (SFPs), each to be identified by the two policy
        oriented components <xref show="link" id="fdp_acc"/>, and <xref show="link" id="fdp_ifc"/>. These policies will typically take
        confidentiality, integrity, and availability aspects into
        consideration as required, to satisfy the TOE
        requirements. Care should be taken to ensure that all objects
        are covered by at least one SFP and that there are no
        conflicts arising from implementing the multiple SFPs.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-808464">
        When building a PP/ST using components from the <xref show="link" id="fdp"/> class, the following information provides guidance
        on where to look and what to select from the class.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-801347">
        The requirements in the <xref show="link" id="fdp"/> class are defined in
        terms of a set of SFRs that will
        implement a SFP. Since a TOE may implement multiple SFPs
        simultaneously, the PP/ST author must specify the name for
        each SFP, so it can be referenced in other families. This name
        will then be used in each component selected to indicate that
        it is being used as part of the definition of requirements for
        that SFP. This allows the author to easily indicate the
        scope for operations such as objects covered, operations
        covered, authorised users, etc.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-798488">
        Each instantiation of a component can apply to only one
        SFP. Therefore if an SFP is specified in a component then
        this SFP will apply to all the elements in this
        component. The components may be instantiated multiple times
        within a PP/ST to account for different policies if so
        desired.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-805260">
        The key to selecting components from this family is to have a
        well defined set of TOE security objectives to enable proper
        selection of the components from the two policy components;
        <xref show="link" id="fdp_acc"/> and <xref show="link" id="fdp_ifc"/>. In <xref show="link" id="fdp_acc"/> and <xref show="link" id="fdp_ifc"/> respectively, all access control
        policies and all information flow control policies are
        named. Furthermore the scope of control of these components in
        terms of the subjects, objects and operations covered by this
        security functionality. The names of these policies are meant
        to be used throughout the remainder of the functional
        components that have an operation that calls for an assignment
        or selection of an ``access control SFP'' or an ``information
        flow control SFP''.  The rules that define the functionality
        of the named access control and information flow control SFPs
        will be defined in the <xref show="link" id="fdp_acf"/> and
        <xref show="link" id="fdp_iff"/> families
        (respectively).</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-805279">
        The following steps are guidance on how this class is applied

      Discretionary Access Control (DAC) mechanisms. It further
      defines the subjects, objects and operations that are covered by
      identified access control SFPs. The rules that define the
      functionality of an access control SFP will be defined by other
      families, such as <xref show="link" id="fdp_acf"/> and <xref show="link" id="fdp_etc"/>. The names of the access control SFPs
      defined in <xref show="link" id="fdp_acc"/> are meant to be used
      throughout the remainder of the functional components that have
      an operation that calls for an assignment or selection of an
      ``access control SFP.''</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-803944">
          The access control SFP covers a set of triplets: subject,
          object, and operations. Therefore a subject can be covered
          by multiple access control SFPs but only with respect to a
          different operation or a different object. Of course the
          same applies to objects and operations.</para>

          A critical aspect of an access control function that
          enforces an access control SFP is the ability for users to
          modify the attributes involved in access control
          decisions. The <xref show="link" id="fdp_acc"/> family does not address
          these aspects. Some of these requirements are left
          undefined, but can be added as refinements, while others are
          covered elsewhere in other families and classes such as
          <xref show="link" id="fmt"/>.</para>

          There are no audit requirements in <xref show="link" id="fdp_acc"/> as
          this family specifies access control SFP requirements. Audit
          requirements will be found in families specifying functions
          to satisfy the access control SFPs identified in this
          family.</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-803982">
          This family provides a PP/ST author the capability to
          specify several policies, for example, a fixed access
          control SFP to be applied to one scope of control, and a
          flexible access control SFP to be defined for a different
          scope of control. To specify more than one access control
          policy, the components from this family can be iterated
          multiple times in a PP/ST to different subsets of operations
          and objects. This will accommodate TOEs that contain
          multiple policies, each addressing a particular set of
          operations and objects. In other words, the PP/ST author
          should specify the required information in the ACC component
          for each of the access control SFPs that the TSF will
          enforce. For example, a TOE incorporating three access
          control SFPs, each covering only a subset of the objects,
          subjects, and operations within the TOE, will contain one
          <xref show="link" id="fdp_acc.1"/> component for each of the three
          access control SFPs, necessitating a total of three <xref show="link" id="fdp_acc.1"/> components.</para>

            operations might be expressed as types such as: named

      operations which cause controlled information to flow to and
      from controlled subjects covered by the policy. The criteria
      allows multiple policies to exist, each having a unique name.
      This is accomplished by iterating components from this family
      once for each named information flow control policy.  The rules
      that define the functionality of an information flow control SFP
      will be defined by other families such as <xref show="link" id="fdp_iff"/> and <xref show="link" id="fdp_etc"/>. The names
      of the information flow control SFPs identified here in <xref show="link" id="fdp_ifc"/> are meant to be used throughout the

      The components in this family are capable of identifying the

      the policy, and operations which cause controlled information to

        Each SFP covers a set of triplets: subject, information, and

        very low level of detail and explicitly describe subjects in

        information flow control policies may be at a high level and
        describe subjects in the generic sense of users or
        input/output channels. If the information flow control
        policy is at too high a level of detail, it may not clearly
        define the desired IT security functions. In such cases, it
        is more appropriate to include such descriptions of
        information flow control policies as objectives. Then the

        flow, there will be a set of rules that define whether the

      This family addresses the need to ensure that any data contained
      in a resource is not available when the resource is de-allocated
      from one object and reallocated to a different object. This
      family requires protection for any data contained in a resource
      that has been logically deleted or released, but may still be
      present within the TSF-controlled resource which in turn may be
      re-allocated to another object.</para>

        <para id="pgfId-799439" type="normal">
      Residual information protection ensures that TSF-controlled
      resources when de-allocated from an object and before they are
      reallocated to another object are treated by the TSF in a way
      that it is not possible to reconstruct all or part of the data
      contained in the resource before it was de-allocated.</para>
        <para id="pgfId-801777" type="normal">
      A TOE usually has a number of functions that potentially
      de-allocate resources from an object and potentially re-allocate
      those resources to objects. Some, but not all of those resources
      may have been used to store critical data from the previous use
      of the resource and for those resources FDP_RIP requires that
      they are prepared for reuse. Object reuse applies to explicit
      requests of a subject or user to release resources as well as
      implicit actions of the TSF that result in the de-allocation and
      subsequent re-allocation of resources to different
      objects. Examples of explicit requests are the deletion or
      truncation of a file or the release of an area of main
      memory. Examples of implicit actions of the TSF are the
      de-allocation and re-allocation of cache regions.</para><para type="normal">
      The requirement for object reuse is related to the content of
      the resource belonging to an object, not all information about
      the resource or object that may be stored elsewhere in the
      TSF. As an example to satisfy the FDP_RIP requirement for files
      as objects requires that all sectors that make up the file need
      to be prepared for re-use.</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-804497">
          It also applies to resources that are serially reused by
          different subjects within the system. For example, most
          operating systems typically rely upon hardware registers
          (resources) to support processes within the system. As
          processes are swapped from a ``run'' state to a ``sleep''
          state (and vice versa), these registers are serially reused
          by different subjects. While this ``swapping'' action may
          not be considered an allocation or deallocation of a
          resource, <xref show="link" id="fdp_rip"/> could apply to
          such events and resources.</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-804493">
          <xref show="link" id="fdp_rip"/> typically controls access
          to information that is not part of any currently defined or
          accessible object; however, in certain cases this may not be
          true. For example, object ``A'' is a file and object ``B''
          is the disk upon which that file resides. If object ``A'' is
          deleted, the information from object ``A'' is under the
          control of <xref show="link" id="fdp_rip"/> even though it
          is still part of object ``B''.</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-804513">
          It is important to note that <xref show="link" id="fdp_rip"/> applies only to on-line objects and not
          off-line objects such as those backed-up on tapes. For
          example, if a file is deleted in the TOE, <xref show="link" id="fdp_rip"/> can be instantiated to require that no
          residual information exists upon deallocation; however, the
          TSF cannot extend this enforcement to that same file that
          exists on the off-line back-up. Therefore that same file is
          still available. If this is a concern, then the PP/ST author
          should make sure that the proper environmental objectives
          are in place to support operational user guidance to address
          off-line objects.</para>

          information be cleared at the time the application releases
          the object to the TSF (i.e. upon deallocation). Therefore,
          the <xref show="link" id="fdp_rip"/> selection of
          ``deallocation'' should not be used with <xref show="link" id="fdp_rol"/> since there would be no information to roll
          back. The other selection, ``unavailability upon
          allocation'', may be used with <xref show="link" id="fdp_rol"/>, but there is the risk that the resource
          which held the information has been allocated to a new
          object before the roll back took place. If that were to

          backups. If backup tapes are rotated, after a tape is
          reused, the information can no longer be retrieved. This

          This family reduces the likelihood of damage resulting from
          users abusing their authority by taking actions outside
          their assigned functional responsibilities. It also
          addresses the threat that inadequate mechanisms have been
          provided to securely administer the TSF.</para>

          This family requires that information be maintained to
          identify whether a user is authorised to use a particular
          security-relevant administrative function.</para>

          Some management actions can be performed by users, others
          only by designated people within the organisation. This
          family allows the definition of different roles, such as
          owner, auditor, administrator, daily-management.</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-10164">
          The roles as used in this family are security related
          roles. Each role can encompass an extensive set of
          capabilities (e.g. root in UNIX), or can be a single right
          (e.g. right to read a single object such as the
          helpfile). This family defines the roles. The capabilities
          of the role are defined in <xref show="link" id="fmt_mof"/>, <xref show="link" id="fmt_msa"/> and <xref show="link" id="fmt_mtd"/>.</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9148">
          Some type of roles might be mutually exclusive. For example
          the daily-management might be able to define and activate
          users, but might not be able to remove users (which is
          reserved for the administrator (role)). This class will
          allow policies such as two-person control to be specified.</para>

      This class contains privacy requirements. These requirements
      provide a user protection against discovery and misuse of
      identity by other users.</para>
  </fc-introduction>
  <fc-informative-notes>
    <para type="normal" id="pgfId-12060">
      This class describes the requirements that could be levied to
      satisfy the users' privacy needs, while still allowing
      the system flexibility as far as possible to maintain
      sufficient control over the operation of the system.</para>
    <para type="normal" id="pgfId-8919">
      In the components of this class there is flexibility as to
      whether or not authorised users are covered by the required
      security functionality. For example, a PP/ST author might
      consider it appropriate not to require protection of the privacy
      of users against a suitably authorised user.</para>
    <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9017">
      This class, together with other classes (such as those
      concerned with audit, access control, trusted path, and
      non-repudiation) provides the flexibility to specify the
      desired privacy behaviour. On the other hand, the requirements
      in this class might impose limitations on the use of the
      components of other classes, such as <xref show="link" id="fia"/> or <xref show="link" id="fau"/>. For example, if
      authorised users are not allowed to see the user identity
      (e.g. Anonymity or Pseudonymity), it will obviously not be
      possible to hold individual users accountable for any security
      relevant actions they perform that are covered by the privacy
      requirements. However, it may still be possible to include
      audit requirements in a PP/ST, where the fact that a
      particular security relevant event has occurred is more
      important than knowing who was responsible for it.</para>
    <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9018">
      Additional information is provided in the application notes
      for class <xref show="link" id="fau"/>, where it is explained that the
      definition of ``identity'' in the context of
      auditing can also be an alias or other information that could
      identify a user.</para>
    <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9019">
      This class describes four families: Anonymity, Pseudonymity,
      Unlinkability and Unobservability. Anonymity, Pseudonymity and
      Unlinkability have a complex interrelationship. When choosing
      a family, the choice should depend on the threats
      identified. For some types of privacy threats, pseudonymity
      will be more appropriate than anonymity (e.g. if there is a
      requirement for auditing). In addition, some types of privacy
      threats are best countered by a combination of components from
      several families.</para>
    <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9020">
      All families assume that a user does not explicitly perform an
      action that discloses the user's own identity. For
      example, the TSF is not expected to screen the user name in
      electronic messages or databases.</para>
    <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9021">
      All families in this class have components that can be scoped
      through operations. These operations allow the PP/ST author to
      state the cooperating users/subjects to which the TSF must be
      resistant. An example of an instantiation of anonymity could
      be: `` The TSF shall ensure that the users and/or
      subjects are unable to determine the user identity bound to
      the teleconsulting application''.</para>
    <para type="normal" id="pgfId-11257">
      It is noted that the TSF should not only provide this
      protection against individual users, but also against users
      cooperating to obtain the information.</para>

  <f-family name="Anonymity" id="fpr_ano">
    <ff-behaviour>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-10829">
        This family ensures that a user may use a resource or
        service without disclosing the user's identity. The
        requirements for Anonymity provide protection of the user
        identity. Anonymity is not intended to protect the subject
        identity.</para>
    </ff-behaviour>
    <ff-user-notes>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9028">
        Anonymity ensures that a subject may use a resource or
        service without disclosing its user identity.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9030">
        The intention of this family is to specify that a user or
        subject might take action without releasing its user
        identity to others such as users, subjects, or objects. The
        family provides the PP/ST author with a means to identify
        the set of users that cannot see the identity of someone
        performing certain actions.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-10263">
        Therefore if a subject, using anonymity, performs an action,
        another subject will not be able to determine either the
        identity or even a reference to the identity of the user
        employing the subject. The focus of the anonymity is on the
        protection of the users identity, not on the protection of
        the subject identity; hence, the identity of the subject is
        not protected from disclosure.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        Although the identity of the subject is not released to
        other subjects or users, the TSF is not explicitly
        prohibited from obtaining the users identity. In case the
        TSF is not allowed to know the identity of the user, <xref show="link" id="fpr_ano.2"/> could be invoked. In that case
        the TSF should not request the user information.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-10272">
        The interpretation of ``determine'' should be
        taken in the broadest sense of the word.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9631">
        The component levelling distinguishes between the users and
        an authorised user. An authorised user is often excluded
        from the component, and therefore allowed to retrieve a
        user's identity. However, there is no specific
        requirement that an authorised user must be able to have the
        capability to determine the user's identity. For
        ultimate privacy the components would be used to say that no
        user or authorised user can see the identity of anyone
        performing any action.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9038">
        Although some systems will provide anonymity for all
        services that are provided, other systems provide anonymity
        for certain subjects/operations. To provide this
        flexibility, an operation is included where the scope of the
        requirement is defined. If the PP/ST author wants to address
        all subjects/operations, the words ``all subjects and
        all operations'' could be provided.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9039">
        Possible applications include the ability to make enquiries
        of a confidential nature to public databases, respond to
        electronic polls, or make anonymous payments or donations.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9040">
        Examples of potential hostile users or subjects are
        providers, system operators, communication partners and
        users, who smuggle malicious parts (e.g. Trojan Horses) into
        systems. All of these users can investigate usage patterns
        (e.g. which users used which services) and misuse this

        Pseudonymity ensures that a user may use a resource or
        service without disclosing its identity, but can still be
        accountable for that use. The user can be accountable by
        directly being related to a reference (alias) held by the
        TSF, or by providing an alias that will be used for
        processing purposes, such as an account number.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9104">
        In several respects, pseudonymity resembles anonymity. Both
        pseudonymity and anonymity protect the identity of the user,
        but in pseudonymity a reference to the user's
        identity is maintained for accountability or other purposes.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9108">
        The component <xref show="link" id="fpr_pse.1"/> does not
        specify the requirements on the reference to the user's
        identity. For the purpose of specifying requirements on this
        reference two sets of requirements are presented: <xref show="link" id="fpr_pse.2"/> and <xref show="link" id="fpr_pse.3"/>.</para>
      <para type="normal">
	A way to use the reference is by being able to obtain the
        original user identity. For example, in a digital cash
        environment it would be advantageous to be able to trace the
        user's identity when a check has been issued multiple times
        (i.e. fraud). In general, the user's identity needs to be
        retrieved under specific conditions. The PP/ST author might
        want to incorporate <xref show="link" id="fpr_pse.2"/> to
        describe those services.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9119">
        Another usage of the reference is as an alias for a
        user. For example, a user who does not wish to be
        identified, can provide an account to which the resource
        utilisation should be charged. In such cases, the reference
        to the user identity is an alias for the user, where other
        users or subjects can use the alias for performing their
        functions without ever obtaining the user's
        identity (for example, statistical operations on use of the
        system). In this case, the PP/ST author might wish to
        incorporate <xref show="link" id="fpr_pse.3"/> to specify the rules to
        which the reference must conform.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-10383">
        Using these constructs above, digital money can be created
        using <xref show="link" id="fpr_pse.2"/> specifying that the user
        identity will be protected and, if so specified in the
        condition, that there be a requirement to trace the user
        identity if the digital money is spent twice. When the user
        is honest, the user identity is protected; if the user tries
        to cheat, the user identity can be traced.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-10385">
        A different kind of system could be a digital credit card,
        where the user will provide a pseudonym that indicates an
        account from which the cash can be subtracted. In such
        cases, for example, <xref show="link" id="fpr_pse.3"/> could be
        used. This component would specify that the user identity
        will be protected and, furthermore, that the same user will
        only get assigned values for which he/she has provided money
        (if so specified in the conditions).</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9137">
        It should be realised that the more stringent components
        potentially cannot be combined with other requirements, such
        as identification and authentication or audit. The
        interpretation of ``determine the identity''
        should be taken in the broadest sense of the word. The
        information is not provided by the TSF during the operation,
        nor can the entity determine the subject or the owner of the
        subject that invoked the operation, nor will the TSF record
        information, available to the users or subjects, which might
        release the user identity in the future.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-10427">
        The intent is that the TSF not reveal any information that
        would compromise the identity of the user, e.g. the identity
        of subjects acting on the user's behalf. The
        information that is considered to be sensitive depends on
        the effort an attacker is capable of spending.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-10431">
        Possible applications include the ability to charge a caller
        for premium rate telephone services without disclosing his
        or her identity, or to be charged for the anonymous use of
        an electronic payment system.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9144">
        Examples of potential hostile users are providers, system
        operators, communication partners and users, who smuggle
        malicious parts (e.g. Trojan Horses) into systems. All of
        these attackers can investigate which users used which
        services and misuse this information. Additionally to
        Anonymity services, Pseudonymity Services contains methods
        for authorisation without identification, especially for
        anonymous payment (``Digital Cash''). This
        helps providers to obtain their payment in a secure way
        while maintaining customer anonymity.</para>

        Unlinkability ensures that a user may make multiple uses of
        resources or services without others being able to link
        these uses together. Unlinkability differs from pseudonymity
        that, although in pseudonymity the user is also not known,
        relations between different actions can be provided.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-10507">
        The requirements for unlinkability are intended to protect
        the user identity against the use of profiling of the
        operations. For example, when a telephone smart card is
        employed with a unique number, the telephone company can
        determine the behaviour of the user of this telephone
        card. When a telephone profile of the users is known, the
        card can be linked to a specific user. Hiding the
        relationship between different invocations of a service or
        access of a resource will prevent this kind of information
        gathering.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-10521">
        As a result, a requirement for unlinkability could imply
        that the subject and user identity of an operation must be
        protected. Otherwise this information might be used to link
        operations together.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-10522">
        Unlinkability requires that different operations cannot be
        related. This relationship can take several forms. For
        example, the user associated with the operation, or the
        terminal which initiated the action, or the time the action
        was executed. The PP/ST author can specify what kind of
        relationships are present that must be countered.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9314">
        Possible applications include the ability to make multiple
        use of a pseudonym without creating a usage pattern that
        might disclose the user's identity.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9315">
        Examples for potential hostile subjects and users are
        providers, system operators, communication partners and
        users, who smuggle malicious parts, (e.g. Trojan Horses)
        into systems, they do not operate but want to get
        information about. All of these attackers can investigate
        (e.g. which users used which services) and misuse this
        information. Unlinkability protects users from linkages,
        which could be drawn between several actions of a
        customer. An example is a series of phone calls made by an
        anonymous customer to different partners, where the
        combination of the partner's identities might disclose the
        identity of the customer.</para>

          <item id="pgfId-11479">
            Allocation of information impacting unobservability:
            Unobservability relevant information (e.g. information
            that describes that an operation occurred) can be
            allocated in several locations within the TOE. The
            information might be allocated to a single randomly
            chosen part of the TOE such that an attacker does not
            know which part of the TOE should be attacked. An
            alternative system might distribute the information such
            that no single part of the TOE has sufficient
            information that, if circumvented, the privacy of the
            user would be compromised. This technique is explicitly

            Broadcast: When information is broadcast (e.g. ethernet,
            radio), users cannot determine who actually received and
            used that information. This technique is especially
            useful when information should reach receivers which
            have to fear a stigma for being interested in that
            information (e.g. sensitive medical information).

            Cryptographic protection and message padding: People

            attributes on that message. By traffic padding, message

          information related to the privacy of the user is

          implemented completely in hardware, below the level of
          interaction with an audit subsystem (for example, a
          hardware-based detection system based on breaking a circuit
          and lighting a light emitting diode (LED) if the circuit is
          broken when a button is pressed by the authorised
          user). Nevertheless, a PP/ST author may determine that for a
          particular anticipated threat environment, there is a need
          to audit physical tampering. If this is the case, the PP/ST
          author should include appropriate requirements in the list
          of audit events. Note that inclusion of these requirements

          This family provides requirements for the availability of
          capabilities even in the case of failures. Examples of such
          failures are power failure, hardware failure, or software
          error. In case of these errors, if so specified, the TOE
          will maintain the specified capabilities. The PP/ST author
          could specify, for example, that a TOE used in a nuclear
          plant will continue the operation of the shut-down procedure
          in the case of power-failure or communication-failure.</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-3699">
          Because the TOE can only continue its correct operation if
          the SFRs are enforced, there is a requirement that the system
          must remain in a secure state after a failure. This
          capability is provided by <xref show="link" id="fpt_fls.1"/>.</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-3703">
          The mechanisms to provide fault tolerance could be active or
          passive. In case of an active mechanism, specific functions
          are in place that are activated in case the error
          occurs. For example, a fire alarm is an active mechanism:
          the TSF will detect the fire and can take action such as
          switching operation to a backup. In a passive scheme, the
          architecture of the TOE is capable of handling the
          error. For example, the use of a majority voting scheme with
          multiple processors is a passive solution; failure of one
          processor will not disrupt the operation of the TOE
          (although it needs to be detected to allow correction).</para>
        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-3704">
          For this family, it does not matter whether the failure has
          been initiated accidentally (such as flooding or unplugging
          the wrong device) or intentionally (such as monopolising).</para>

        The establishment of a user's session typically

          the location or port of access; and/or the time

        <para type="normal" id="pgfId-292287">
          This family provides the capability for a PP/ST author to
          specify requirements for the TSF to place limits on the
          domain of an authorised user's security attributes
          based on an environmental condition. For example, a user may
          be allowed to establish a ``secret session''
          during normal business hours but outside those hours the
          same user may be constrained to only establishing
          ``unclassified sessions''. The identification of
          relevant constraints on the domain of selectable attributes
          can be achieved through the use of the selection
          operation. These constraints can be applied on an
          attribute-by-attribute basis. When there exists a need to
          specify constraints on multiple attributes this component
          will have to be replicated for each attribute. Examples of
          attributes that could be used to limit the session security
          attributes are:

            <item id="pgfId-292288">

            </item>
            <item id="pgfId-292289">
              The location of access can be used to constrain the
              domain of a user's selectable attributes based
              on a user's location or port of access. This
              capability is of particular use in environments where
              dial-up facilities or network facilities are available.
            </item>

              The time of access can be used to constrain the domain

              ranges may be based upon time-of-day, day-of-week, or
              calendar dates. This constraint provides some
              operational protection against user actions that could
              occur at a time where proper monitoring or where proper

          This family provides the capability for the PP/ST author to
          specify requirements for the TOE to place constraints on the
          ability of an authorised user to establish a session with
          the TOE. The identification of relevant constraints can be
          achieved through the use of the selection

        Families in this class provide requirements for a trusted
        communication path between users and the TSF, and for a
        trusted communication channel between the TSF and other
        trusted IT products. Trusted paths and channels have the
        following general characteristics:
        <list type="itemized">
          <item id="pgfId-243">
            The communications path is constructed using internal and
            external communications channels (as appropriate for the
            component) that isolate an identified subset of TSF data
            and commands from the remainder of the TSF and user data.
          </item>
          <item id="pgfId-244">
            Use of the communications path may be initiated by the
            user and/or the TSF (as appropriate for the component).
          </item>
          <item id="pgfId-245">
            The communications path is capable of providing assurance
            that the user is communicating with the correct TSF, and
            that the TSF is communicating with the correct user (as
            appropriate for the component).
          </item>
        </list></para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-246">
        In this paradigm, a trusted channel is a communication channel
        that may be initiated by either side of the channel, and
        provides non-repudiation characteristics with respect to the
        identity of the sides of the channel.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-641">
        A trusted path provides a means for users to perform functions
        through an assured direct interaction with the TSF. Trusted
        path is usually desired for user actions such as initial
        identification and/or authentication, but may also be desired
        at other times during a user's session. Trusted
        path exchanges may be initiated by a user or the TSF. User
        responses via the trusted path are guaranteed to be protected
        from modification by or disclosure to untrusted applications.</para>
    </fc-introduction>
    <fc-informative-notes>
      <para id="pgfId-1787" type="normal">
          Users often need to perform functions through direct
          interaction with the TSF. A trusted path provides confidence
          that a user is communicating directly with the TSF whenever it
          is invoked. A user's response via the trusted path
          guarantees that untrusted applications cannot intercept or
          modify the user's response. Similarly, trusted
          channels are one approach for secure communication between the
          TSF and another trusted IT product.</para>
      <para type="normal" id="pgfId-1795">
        Absence of a trusted path may allow breaches of accountability
        or access control in environments where untrusted applications
        are used. These applications can intercept user-private
        information, such as passwords, and use it to impersonate
        other users. As a consequence, responsibility for any system
        actions cannot be reliably assigned to an accountable
        entity. Also, these applications could output erroneous
        information on an unsuspecting user's display,
        resulting in subsequent user actions that may be erroneous and
        may lead to a security breach.</para>

        are designed to provide confidence that a composed TOE will
        operate securely when relying upon security functionality
        provided by previously evaluated software, firmware or
        hardware components.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        Composition involves taking two or more IT entities
        successfully evaluated against CC security assurance
        requirements packages (base components and dependent
        components, see <xref id="aco-annex" show="link"/>) and
        combining them for use, with no further development of either
        IT entity. The development of additional IT entities is not
        included (entities that have not previously been the subject
        of a component evaluation). The composed TOE forms a new
        product that can be installed and integrated into any specific
        environment instance that meets the objectives for the
        environment.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        This approach does not provide an alternative approach for the
        evaluation of components. Composition under <xref id="aco" show="id"/> provides a composed TOE integrator a method, which
        can be used as an alternative to other assurance levels
        specified in the CC, to gain confidence in a TOE that is the
        combination of two or more successfully evaluated components
        without having to re-evaluate the composite TSF. (The composed
        TOE integrator is referred to as ``developer'' throughout the
        <xref id="aco" show="id"/> class, with any references to the
        developer of the base or dependent components clarified as
        such.)</para>
      <para type="normal">
        Composed Assurance Packages, as defined in Clauses <xref id="capclause" show="link"/> and <xref id="assurance-requirements-cap-structure" show="link"/>, is an
        assurance scale for composed TOEs. This assurance scale is
        required in addition to EALs because to combine components
        evaluated against EALs and gain a resulting EAL assurance, all
        SARs in the EAL have to be applied to the composed
        TOE. Although reuse can be made of the component TOE
        evaluation results, there are often additional aspects of the
        components that have to be considered in the composed TOE, as
        described in Annex <xref id="aco-interactions-IT-entities" show="link"/>. Due to the different parties involved in a
        composed TOE evaluation activity it is generally not possible
        to gain all necessary evidence about these additional aspects
        of the components to apply the appropriate EAL. Hence, CAPs
        have been defined to address the issue of combining evaluated
        components and gaining a meaningful result. This is discussed
        further in <xref id="aco-annex" show="link"/>.</para>

      <para type="normal">
        In a composed TOE it is generally the case that one component
        relies on the services provided by another component. The
        component requiring services is termed the dependent component
        and the component providing the services is termed the base
        component. This interaction and distinct is discussed further
        in Annex B. It is assumed to be the case that the developer of
        the dependent component is supporting the composed TOE
        evaluation in some manner (as developer, sponsor, or just
        cooperating and providing the necessary evaluation evidence
        from the dependent component evaluation) The <xref id="aco" show="id"/> components included in the CAP assurance packages
        should not be used as augmentations for component TOE
        evaluations, as this would provide no meaningful assurance for
        the component.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        The families within the <xref id="aco" show="id"/> class
        interact in a similar manner to the <xref id="adv" show="id"/>, <xref id="ate" show="id"/> and <xref id="ava" show="id"/> classes in a component TOE evaluation and hence
        leverage from the specification of requirements from those
        classes where applicable. There are however a few items
        specific to composed TOE evaluations. To determine how the
        components interact and identify any deviations from the
        evaluations of the components, the dependencies that the
        dependent component has upon the underlying base component are
        identified (<xref id="aco_rel" show="id"/>). This reliance on
        the base component is specified in terms of the interfaces
        through which the dependent component makes calls for services
        in support of the dependent component SFRs. The interfaces,
        and at higher levels the supporting behaviour, provided by the
        base component in response to those service requests are
        analysed in <xref id="aco_dev" show="id"/>. The <xref id="aco_dev" show="id"/> family is based on the <xref id="adv_tds" show="id"/> family, as at the simplest level the
        TSF of each component can be viewed as a subsystem of the
        composed TOE, with additional portions of each component seen
        as additional subsystems. Therefore, the interfaces between
        the components are seen as interactions between subsystems in
        a component TOE evaluation.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        It is possible that the interfaces and supporting behaviour
        descriptions provided for <xref id="aco_dev" show="id"/> are
        incomplete. This is determined during the conduct of <xref id="aco_cor" show="id"/>. The <xref id="aco_cor" show="id"/>
        family takes the outputs of <xref id="aco_rel" show="id"/> and
        <xref id="aco_dev" show="id"/> and determines whether the
        components are being used in their evaluated configuration and
        identifies where any specifications are incomplete, which are
        then identified as inputs into testing (<xref id="aco_ctt" show="id"/>) and vulnerability analysis (<xref id="aco_vul" show="id"/>) activities of the composed TOE.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        Testing of the composed TOE is performed to determine that the
        composed TOE exhibits the expected behaviour as determined by
        the composed TOE SFRs, and at higher levels demonstrates the
        compatibility of the interfaces between the components of the
        composed TOE.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        The vulnerability analysis of the composed TOE leverages from
        the outputs of the vulnerability analysis of the component
        evaluations. The composed TOE vulnerability analysis considers
        any residual vulnerabilities from the component evaluations to
        determine that the residual vulnerabilities are not applicable
        to the composed TOE. A search of publicly available
        information relating to the components is also performed to
        identify any issues reported in the components since the
        completion of the respective evaluations.</para>

      <para type="normal">
        The <xref id="aco_rel" show="link"/> family identifies where
        the dependent component is reliant upon IT in its operational
        environment (satisfied by a base component in the composed TOE
        evaluation) in order to provide its own security
        services. This reliance is identified in terms of the
        interfaces expected by the dependent component to be provided
        by the base component. <xref id="aco_dev" show="link"/> then
        determines which interfaces of the base component were
        considered (as TSFI) during the component evaluation of the
        base component.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        It should be noted that <xref id="aco_rel" show="link"/> does
        not cover other evidence that may be needed to address the
        technical integration problem of composing components
        (e.g. descriptions of non-TSF interfaces of the operating
        system, rules for integration, etc.). This is outside the
        security assessment of the composition and is a functional
        composition issue.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        As part of <xref id="aco_ctt" show="link"/> the evaluator will
        perform testing of the composed TOE SFRs at the composed TOE
        interfaces and of the interfaces of the base component relied
        upon by the dependent component to confirm they operate as
        specified. The subset selected will consider the possible
        effects of changes to the configuration/use of the base
        component as used in the composed TOE. These changes are
        identified from the configuration of the base component
        determined during the base component evaluation. The developer
        will provide test evidence for each of the base component
        interfaces (the requirements for coverage are consistent with
        those applied to the evaluation of the base component).</para>
      <para type="normal">
        <xref id="aco_cor" show="link"/> requires the evaluator to
        determine whether the appropriate assurance measures have been
        applied to the base component, and whether the base component
        is being used in its evaluated configuration. This includes
        determination of whether all security functionality required
        by the dependent component was within the TSF of the base
        component. The <xref id="aco_cor" show="link"/> requirement
        may be met through the production of evidence that each of
        these is demonstrated to be upheld. This evidence may be in
        the form of the security target and a public report of the
        component evaluation (e.g. certification report).</para>
      <para type="normal">
        If, on the other hand, one of the above have not been upheld,
        then it may be possible that an argument can be made as to why
        the assurance gained during an original evaluation is
        unaffected. If this is not possible then additional evaluation
        evidence for those aspects of the base component not covered
        may have to be provided. This material is then assessed in
        <xref id="aco_dev" show="link"/>.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        For example, it may be the case as described in the
        Interactions between entities (see Annex <xref show="none" id="aco-interactions-IT-entities"/> in CC Part 3) that the
        dependent component requires the base component to provide
        more security functionality in the composed TOE than included
        in the base component evaluation. This would be determined
        during the application of the <xref id="aco_rel" show="link"/>
        and <xref id="aco_dev" show="link"/> families. In this case
        the composition rationale evidence provided for <xref id="aco_cor" show="link"/> would demonstrate that the
        assurance gained from the base component evaluation is
        unaffected. This may be achieved by means including:
        <list type="enumerated">

          integration in the composed TOE. That is, the SARs claimed
          by the base component are consistent with the SARs in the
          assurance package for the composed TOE. (e.g. if the

          necessary to report an assessment of the residual risk to
          assist consumers of the composed TOE

          The TSF of the base component is often defined without

          with which it may by composed. The TSF of this base
          component is defined to include all parts of the base
          component that have to be relied upon for enforcement of the
          base component SFRs. This will include all parts of the base

          operations of the TSF.  This includes interfaces to the
          human user to permit interaction with the operation of the

              The purpose of describing the interactions between the

              services to support the operation of security
              functionality of the dependent component. These

              routine in a component to a routine in another

              unit, and vice versa. An interface that does not

        The requirements of the Development class provide information
        about the TOE. The knowledge obtained by this information is
        used as the basis for conducting vulnerability analysis and

      <para type="normal">
        The Development class encompasses six families of requirements
        for structuring and representing the TSF at various levels and
        varying forms of abstraction. These families include:
        <list type="itemized">
          <item>requirements for the description (at the various
            levels of abstraction) of the design and implementation of
            the SFRs (<xref id="adv_fsp" show="id"/>, <xref id="adv_tds" show="id"/>, <xref id="adv_imp" show="id"/>)</item>
          <item>requirements for the description of the

          <item>requirements on the internal structure of the TSF,

      <para type="normal">
        When documenting the security functionality of a TOE, there
        are two properties that need to be demonstrated.  The first
        property is that the security functionality works correctly;
        that is, it performs as specified. The second property, and
        one that is arguably harder to demonstrate, is that the TOE
        cannot be used in a way such that the security functionality
        can be corrupted or bypassed. These two properties require
        somewhat different approaches in analysis, and so the families
        in <xref id="adv" show="id"/> are structured to support these
        different approaches. The families <xref id="adv_fsp" show="link"/>, <xref id="adv_tds" show="link"/>, <xref id="adv_imp" show="link"/>, and <xref id="adv_spm" show="link"/> deal with the first property: the specification
        of the security functionality. The families <xref id="adv_arc" show="link"/> and <xref id="adv_int" show="link"/> deal with
        the second property: the specification of the design of the
        TOE demonstrating the security functionality cannot be
        corrupted or bypassed. It should be noted that both properties
        need to be realised: the more confidence one has that the
        properties are satisfied, the more trustworthy the TOE is. The
        components in the families are designed so that more assurance
        can be gained as the components hierarchically
        increase.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        The paradigm for the families targeted at the first property
        is one of design decomposition. At the highest level, there is
        a functional specification of the TSF in terms of its
        interfaces (describing <italic>what</italic> the TSF does in
        terms of requests to the TSF for services and resulting
        responses), decomposing the TSF into smaller units (dependent
        on the assurance desired and the complexity of the TOE) and
        describing <italic>how</italic> the TSF accomplishes its
        functions (to a level of detail commensurate with the
        assurance level), and showing the implementation of the TSF. A
        formal model of the security behaviour also may be given. All
        levels of decomposition are used in determining the
        completeness and accuracy of all other levels, ensuring that
        the levels are mutually supportive. The requirements for the
        various TSF representations are separated into different
        families, to allow the PP/ST author to specify which TSF
        representations are required. The level chosen will dictate
        the assurance desired/gained.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        Figure <xref show="id" id="adv-relationships"/> indicates the
        relationships among the various TSF representations of the
        <xref id="adv" show="id"/> class, as well as their
        relationships with other classes. As the figure indicates, the
        <xref id="ape" show="id"/> and <xref id="ase" show="id"/>
        classes define the requirements for the correspondence between
        the SFRs and the security objectives for the TOE. Class <xref id="ase" show="id"/> also defines requirements for the
        correspondence between both the security objectives and SFRs,
        and for the TOE summary specification which explains how the
        TOE meets its SFRs.  The activities of <xref id="alc_cmc.5.2e" show="id"/> include the verification that the TSF that is
        tested under the <xref id="ate" show="id"/> and <xref id="ava" show="id"/> classes is in fact the one described by all of the
        <xref id="adv" show="id"/> decomposition levels.</para>

      <para type="normal">
        The requirements for all other correspondence shown in Figure
        <xref show="id" id="adv-relationships"/> are defined in the
        <xref id="adv" show="id"/> class. The <xref id="adv_spm" show="link"/> family defines the requirements for formally
        modelling selected SFRs, and providing correspondence between
        the functional specification and the formal model.  Each
        assurance family specific to a TSF representation (i.e., <xref id="adv_fsp" show="link"/>, <xref id="adv_tds" show="link"/>
        and <xref id="adv_imp" show="link"/>) defines requirements
        relating that TSF representation to the SFRs. All
        decompositions must accurately reflect all other
        decompositions (i.e., be mutually supportive); the developer
        supplies the tracings in the last .C elements of the
        components. Assurance relating to this factor is obtained
        during the analysis for each of the levels of decomposition by
        referring to other levels of decomposition (in a recursive
        fashion) while the analysis of a particular level of
        decomposition is being performed; the evaluator verifies the
        correspondence as part of the second E element. The
        understanding gained from these levels of decomposition form
        the basis of the functional and penetration testing
        efforts.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        The <xref id="adv_int" show="id"/> family is not represented
        in this figure, as it is related to the internal structure of
        the TSF, and is only indirectly related to the process of
        refinement of the TSF representations. Similarly, the <xref id="adv_arc" show="id"/> family is not represented in the
        figure because it relates to the architectural soundness,
        rather than representation, of the TSF. Both <xref id="adv_int" show="id"/> and <xref id="adv_arc" show="id"/>
        relate to the analysis of the property that the TOE cannot be
        made to circumvent or corrupt its security
        functionality.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        The TOE security functionality (TSF) consists of all parts of
        the TOE that have to be relied upon for enforcement of the
        SFRs. The TSF includes both functionality that directly
        enforces the SFRs, as well as functionality that, while not
        directly enforcing the SFRs, contributes to their enforcement
        in a more indirect manner, including functionality with the
        capability to cause the SFRs to be violated. This includes
        portions of the TOE that are invoked on start-up that are
        responsible for putting the TSF into its initial secure
        state.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        Several important concepts were used in the development of the
        components of the <xref id="adv" show="id"/> families. These
        concepts, while introduced briefly here, are explained more
        fully in the application notes for the families.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        One over-riding notion is that, as more information becomes
        available, greater assurance can be obtained that the security
        functionality 1) is correctly implemented; 2) cannot be
        corrupted; and 3) cannot be bypassed. This is done through the
        verification that the documentation is correct and consistent
        with other documentation, and by providing information that
        can be used to ensure that the testing activities (both
        functional and penetration testing) are comprehensive. This is
        reflected in the levelling of the components of the
        families. In general, components are levelled based on the
        amount of information that is to be provided (and subsequently
        analysed).</para>
      <para type="normal">
        While not true for all TOEs, it is generally the case that the
        TSF is sufficiently complex that there are portions of the TSF
        that deserve more intense examination than other portions of
        the TSF. Determining those portions is unfortunately somewhat
        subjective, thus terminology and components have been defined
        such that as the level of assurance increases, the
        responsibility for determining what portions of the TSF need
        to be examined in detail shifts from the developer to the
        evaluator. To aid in expressing this concept, the following
        terminology is introduced. It should be noted that in the
        families of the class, this terminology is used when
        expressing SFR-related portions of the TOE (that is, elements
        and work units embodied in the <xref id="adv_fsp" show="link"/>, <xref id="adv_tds" show="link"/>, and <xref id="adv_imp" show="link"/> families). While the general
        concept (that some portions of the TOE are more
        <italic>interesting</italic> than others) applies to other
        families, the criteria are expressed differently in order to
        obtain the assurance required.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        All portions of the TSF are <italic>security
          relevant</italic>, meaning that they must preserve the
          security of the TOE as expressed by the SFRs and
          requirements for domain separation and
          non-bypassability. One aspect of security relevance is the
          degree to which a portion of the TSF enforces a security
          requirement. Since different portions of the TOE play
          different roles (or no apparent role at all) in enforcing
          security requirements, this creates a continuum of SFR
          relevance: at one end of this continuum are portions of the
          TOE that are termed <italic>SFR-enforcing</italic>. Such
          portions play a direct role in implementing any SFR on the
          TOE. Such SFRs refer to any functionality provided by one of
          the SFRs contained in the ST. It should be noted that the
          definition of <italic>plays a role in</italic> for
          SFR-enforcing functionality is impossible to express
          quantitatively. For example, in the implementation of a
          Discretionary Access Control (DAC) mechanism, a very narrow
          view of <italic>SFR-enforcing</italic> might be the several
          lines of code that actually perform the check of a subject's
          attributes against the object's attributes. A broader view
          would include the software entity (e.g., C function) that
          contained the several lines of code. A broader view still
          would include callers of the C function, since they would be
          responsible for enforcing the decision returned by the
          attribute check. A still broader view would include any code
          in the call tree (or programming equivalent for the
          implementation language used) for that C function (e.g., a
          sort function that sorted access control list entries in a
          first-match algorithm implementation). At some point, the
          component is not so much <italic>enforcing</italic> the
          security policy but rather plays a
          <italic>supporting</italic> role; such components are termed
          <italic>SFR supporting</italic>.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        One of the characteristics of SFR-supporting functionality is
        that it is trusted to preserve the correctness of the SFR
        implementation by operating without error. Such functionality
        may be depended on by SFR-enforcing functionality, but the
        dependence is generally at a functional level; for example,
        memory management, buffer management, etc. Further down on the
        security relevance continuum is functionality termed
        <italic>SFR non-interfering</italic>. Such functionality has
        no role in implementing the SFRs, and is likely part of the
        TSF because of its environment; for example, any code running
        in a privileged hardware mode on an operating system. It needs
        to be considered part of the TSF because, if compromised (or
        replaced by malicious code), it could compromise the correct
        operation of an SFR by virtue of its operating in the
        privileged hardware mode. An example of SFR non-interfering
        functionality might be a set of mathematical floating point
        operations implemented in kernel mode for speed
        considerations.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        The architecture family (<xref id="adv_arc" show="link"/>)
        provides for requirements and analysis of the TOE based on
        properties of domain separation, self-protection, and
        non-bypassability. These properties relate to the SFRs in
        that, if these properties are not present, it will likely lead
        to the failure of mechanisms implementing SFRs. Functionality
        and design relating to these properties <italic>is
        not</italic> considered a part of the continuum described
        above, but instead is treated separately due to its
        fundamentally different nature and analysis
        requirements.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        The difference in analysis of the implementation of SFRs
        (SFR-enforcing and SFR-supporting functionality) and the
        implementation of somewhat fundamental security properties of
        the TOE, which include the initialisation, self-protection,
        and non-bypassability concerns, is that the SFR-related
        functionality is more or less directly visible and relatively
        easy to test, while the above-mentioned properties require
        varying degrees of analysis on a much broader set of
        functionality. Further, the depth of analysis for such
        properties will vary depending on the design of the TOE. The
        <xref id="adv" show="id"/> families are constructed to address
        this by a separate family (<xref id="adv_arc" show="link"/>)
        devoted to analysis of the initialisation, self-protection,
        and non-bypassability requirements, while the other families
        are concerned with analysis of the functionality supporting
        SFRs.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        Even in cases where different descriptions are necessary for
        the multiple levels of abstraction, it is not absolutely
        necessary for each and every TSF representation to be in a
        separate document. Indeed, it may be the case that a single
        document meets the documentation requirements for more than
        one TSF representation, since it is the information about each
        of these TSF representations that is required, rather than the
        resulting document structure. In cases where multiple TSF
        representations are combined within a single document, the
        developer should indicate which portions of the documents meet
        which requirements.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        Three types of specification style are mandated by this class:
        informal, semiformal and formal. The functional specification
        and TOE design documentation are always written in either
        informal or semiformal style. A semiformal style reduces the
        ambiguity in these documents over an informal presentation. A
        formal specification may also be required <italic>in addition
        to</italic> the semi-formal presentation; the value is that a
        description of the TSF in more than one way will add increased
        assurance that the TSF has been completely and accurately
        specified.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        An informal specification is written as prose in natural
        language. Natural language is used here as meaning
        communication in any commonly spoken tongue (e.g. Spanish,
        German, French, English, Dutch). An informal specification is
        not subject to any notational or special restrictions other
        than those required as ordinary conventions for that language
        (e.g. grammar and syntax). While no notational restrictions
        apply, the informal specification is also required to provide
        defined meanings for terms that are used in a context other
        than that accepted by normal usage.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        The difference between semiformal and informal documents is
        only a matter of formatting or presentation: a semiformal
        notation includes such things as an explicit glossary of
        terms, a standardised presentation format, etc. A semiformal
        specification is written to a standard presentation
        template. The presentation should use terms consistently if
        written in a natural language. The presentation may also use
        more structured languages/diagrams (e.g. data-flow diagrams,
        state transition diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, data
        structure diagrams, and process or program structure
        diagrams). Whether based on diagrams or natural language, a
        set of conventions must be used in the presentation. The
        glossary explicitly identifies the words that are being used
        in a precise and constant manner; similarly, the standardised
        format implies that extreme care has been taken in
        methodically preparing the document in a manner that maximises
        clarity. It should be noted that fundamentally different
        portions of the TSF may have different semiformal notation
        conventions and presentation styles (as long as the number of
        different ``semiformal notations'' is small); this still
        conforms to the concept of a <italic>semiformal
        presentation</italic>.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        A formal specification is written in a notation based upon
        well-established mathematical concepts, and is typically
        accompanied by supporting explanatory (informal) prose. These
        mathematical concepts are used to define the syntax and
        semantics of the notation and the proof rules that support
        logical reasoning. The syntactic and semantic rules supporting
        a formal notation should define how to recognise constructs
        unambiguously and determine their meaning. There needs to be
        evidence that it is impossible to derive contradictions, and
        all rules supporting the notation need to be defined or
        referenced.</para>

        The purpose of the Development class is to provide evidence

        The purpose of the development activity is to assess the
        design documentation in terms of its adequacy to understand
        how the TSF meets the SFRs and how the implementation of these
        SFRs cannot be tampered with or bypassed. This understanding
        is achieved through examination of increasingly refined
        descriptions of the TSF design documentation. Design
        documentation consists of a functional specification (which
        describes the interfaces of the TSF), a TOE design description
        (which describes the architecture of the TSF in terms of how
        it works in order to perform the functions related to the SFRs
        being claimed), and an implementation description (a source
        code level description). In addition, there is a security
        architecture description (which describes the architectural
        properties of the TSF to explain how its security enforcement
        cannot be compromised or bypassed), an internals description
        (which describes how the TSF was constructed in a manner that
        encourages understandability), and a security policy model

        The CC requirements for design documentation are levelled by
        the amount, and detail of information provided, and the degree
        of formality of the presentation of the information. At lower
        levels, the most security-critical portions of the TSF are
        described with the most detail, while less security-critical
        portions of the TSF are merely summarised; added assurance is
        gained by increasing the amount of information about the most
        security-critical portions of the TSF, and increasing the
        details about the less security-critical portions. The most
        assurance is achieved when thorough details and information of
        all portions are provided.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        The CC considers a document's degree of formality (that is,
        whether it is informal or semiformal) to be hierarchical. An
        informal document is one that is expressed in a natural
        language. The methodology does not dictate the specific
        language that must be used; that issue is left for the
        scheme. The following paragraphs differentiate the contents of
        the different informal documents.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        A functional specification provides a description of the
        purpose and method-of-use of interfaces to the TSF. For
        example, if an operating system presents the user with a means
        of self-identification, of creating files, of modifying or
        deleting files, of setting permissions defining what other
        users may access files, and of communicating with remote
        machines, its functional specification would contain
        descriptions of each of these and how they are realised
        through interactions with the externally-visible interfaces to

        record the occurrences of such events, descriptions of this
        audit functionality would also be expected to be part of the

        technically not directly invoked by the user at the external

        A design description is expressed in terms of logical
        divisions (subsystems or modules) that each provide a
        comprehensible service or function. For example, a firewall
        might be composed of subsystems that deal with packet
        filtering, with remote administration, with auditing, and with
        connection-level filtering. The design description of the
        firewall would describe the actions that are taken, in terms
        of what actions each subsystem takes when an incoming packet

              checking of inputs on a trusted server). The evaluator

          The evaluator determines that the design description
          covers how user input is handled by the TSF in such a
          way that the TSF does not subject itself to being
          corrupted by that user input. For example, the TSF might
          implement the notion of privilege and protect itself by
          using privileged-mode routines to handle user input. The
          TSF might make use of processor-based separation
          mechanisms such as privilege levels or rings. The TSF
          might implement software protection constructs or coding
          conventions that contribute to implementing separation of
          software domains, perhaps by delineating user address
          space from system address space. And the TSF might have
          reliance its environment to provide some support to the
          protection of the TSF.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              All of the mechanisms contributing to the domain
              separation functions are described. The evaluator should
              use knowledge gained from other evidence (functional
              specification, TOE design, TSF internals description,
              other parts of the security architecture description, or
              implementation representation, as included in the
              assurance package for the TOE) in determining if any

              The evaluator shall examine the security architecture
              description to determine that it presents an analysis

              mechanisms cannot be bypassed.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              Non-bypassability is a property that the security
              functionality of the TSF (as specified by the SFRs) is
              always invoked.  For example, if access control to files
              is specified as a capability of the TSF via an SFR,
              there must be no interfaces through which files can be
              accessed without invoking the TSF's access control
              mechanism (such as an interface through which a raw disk
              access takes place).</para>
            <para type="normal">
              Describing how the TSF mechanisms cannot be bypassed
              generally requires a systematic argument based on the
              TSF and the TSFIs. The description of how the TSF works
              (contained in the design decomposition evidence, such as
              the functional specification, TOE design documentation)
              - along with the information in the TSS - provides the
              background necessary for the evaluator to understand
              what resources are being protected and what security
              functions are being provided. The functional
              specification provides descriptions of the TSFIs through
              which the resources/functions are accessed.</para>
            <para type="normal">
      The evaluator assesses the description provided (and other
      information provided by the developer, such as the functional
      specification) to ensure that no available interface can be used
      to bypass the TSF. This means that every available interface
      must be either unrelated to the SFRs that are claimed in the ST
      (and does not interact with anything that is used to satisfy
      SFRs) or else uses the security functionality that is described
      in other development evidence in the manner described. For
      example, a game would likely be unrelated to the SFRs, so there
      must be an explanation of how it cannot affect security. Access
      to user data, however, is likely to be related to access control
      SFRs, so the explanation would describe how the security
      functionality works when invoked through the data-access
      interfaces.  Such a description is needed for every available
      interface.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              An example of a description follows. Suppose the TSF
              provides file protection. Further suppose that although
              the ``traditional'' system call TSFIs for open, read,
              and write invoke the file protection mechanism described
              in the TOE design, there exists a TSFI that allows
              access to a batch job facility (creating batch jobs,
              deleting jobs, modifying unprocessed jobs). The
              evaluator should be able to determine from the
              vendor-provided description that this TSFI invokes the
              same protection mechanisms as do the ``traditional''
              interfaces. This could be done, for example, by
              referencing the appropriate subclauses of the TOE design
              that discuss <italic>how</italic> the batch job facility
              TSFI achieves its security objectives.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              Using this same example, suppose there is a TSFI whose
              sole purpose is to display the time of day. The
              evaluator should determine that the description
              adequately argues that this TSFI is not capable of
              manipulating any protected resources and should not
              invoke any security functionality.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              Another example of bypass is when the TSF is supposed to
              maintain confidentiality of a cryptographic key (one is
              allowed to use it for cryptographic operations, but is
              not allowed to read/write it). If an attacker has direct
              physical access to the device, he might be able to
              examine side-channels such as the power usage of the
              device, the exact timing of the device, or even any
              electromagnetic emanations of the device and, from this,
              infer the key.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              If such side-channels may be present, the demonstration
              should address the mechanisms that prevent these
              side-channels from occurring, such as random internal
              clocks, dual-line technology etc. Verification of these
              mechanisms would be verified by a combination of purely
              design-based arguments and testing.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              For a final example using security functionality rather
              than a protected resource, consider an ST that contains
              <xref id="fco_nro.2" show="link"/>, which requires that
              the TSF provides evidence of origination for information
              types specified in the ST. Suppose that the
              ``information types'' included all information that is
              sent by the TOE via e-mail. In this case the evaluator
              should examine the description to ensure that all TSFI
              that can be invoked to send e-mail perform the
              ``evidence of origination generation'' function are
              detailed. The description might point to user guidance
              to show all places where e-mail can originate (e.g.,
              e-mail program, notification from scripts/batch jobs)
              and then how each of these places invokes the evidence
              generation function.</para>
            <para type="normal">
	The evaluator should also ensure that the description is comprehensive, in that each 
	interface is analysed with respect to the entire set of claimed SFRs. This may require the 
	evaluator to examine supporting information (functional specification, TOE design, other 
	parts of the security architecture description, operational user guidance, and perhaps even 
	the implementation representation, as provided for the TOE) to determine that the description 
	has correctly capture all aspects of an interface. The evaluator should consider what SFRs each 
	TSFI might affect (from the description of the TSFI and its implementation in the supporting 
	documentation), and then examine the description to determine whether it covers those aspects.</para>

          Once the TSFIs are determined (see <xref id="TSFI-determination" show="title"/> for guidance and
          examples of determining TSFI), they are described. At
          lower-level components, developers focus their documentation
          (and evaluators focus their analysis) on the more
          security-relevant aspects of the TOE. Three categories of
          TSFIs are defined, based upon the relevance the services
          available through them have to the SFRs being claimed: <list type="itemized">
            <item>If a service available through an interface can be
              traced to one of the SFRs levied on the TSF, then that
              interface is termed <italic>SFR-enforcing</italic>.
              Note that it is possible that an interface may have
              various services and results, some of which may be
              SFR-enforcing and some of which may not.</item>
            <item>interfaces to (or services available through an
              interface relating to) services that SFR-enforcing
              functionality depends upon, but need only to function
              correctly in order for the security policies of the TOE
              to be preserved, are termed
              <italic>SFR-supporting</italic>. </item>
            <item>Interfaces to services on which SFR-enforcing
              functionality has no dependence are termed <italic>SFR
              non-interfering</italic>.</item></list></para>
        <para type="normal">
          It should be noted that in order for an interface to be
          SFR-supporting or SFR non-interfering it must have
          <italic>no</italic> SFR-enforcing services or results. In
          contrast, an SFR-enforcing interface may have SFR-supporting
          services (for example, the ability to set the system clock
          may be an SFR-enforcing service of an interface, but if that
          same interface is used to display the system date that
          service may be only SFR-supporting).  An example of a purely
          SFR-supporting interface is a system call interface that is
          used both by users and by a portion of the TSF that is
          running on behalf of users.</para>
        <para type="normal">
      As more information about the TSFIs becomes available, the
      greater the assurance that can be gained that the interfaces are
      correctly categorised/analysed. The requirements are structured
      such that, at the lowest level, the information required for SFR
      non-interfering interfaces is the minimum necessary in order for
      the evaluator to make this determination in an effective
      manner. At higher levels, more information becomes available so
      that the evaluator has greater confidence in the
      designation.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          The purpose in defining these labels (SFR-enforcing,
          SFR-supporting, and SFR-non-interfering) and for levying
          different requirements upon each (at the lower assurance
          components) is to provide a first approximation of where to
          focus the analysis and the evidence upon which that analysis
          is performed. If the developer's documentation of the TSF
          interfaces describes all of the interfaces to the degree
          specified in the requirements for the SFR-enforcing
          interfaces (that is, if the documentation exceeds the
          requirements), there is no need for the developer to create
          new evidence to match the requirements. Similarly, because
          the labels are merely a means of differentiating the
          interface types within the requirements, there is no need
          for the developer to update the evidence solely to label the
          interfaces as SFR-enforcing, SFR-supporting, and
          SFR-non-interfering. The primary purpose of this labelling
          is to allow developers with less mature development
          methodologies (and associated artifacts, such as detailed
          interface and design documentation) to provide only the
          necessary evidence without undue cost.</para>
        <para type="normal">
      The last C element of each component within this family provides
      a direct correspondence between the SFRs and the functional
      specification; that is, an indication of which interfaces are

      ST contains such functional requirements as <xref id="fdp_rip" show="link"/>, whose functionality may not manifest itself at
      the TSFIs, the functional specification and/or the tracing is
      expected to identify these SFRs; including them in the functional

              The purpose of a TSFI is a general statement summarising
              the functionality provided by the interface. It is not
              intended to be a complete statement of the actions and
              results related to the interface, but rather a statement
              to help the reader understand in general what the
              interface is intended to be used for. The evaluator
              should not only determine that the purpose exists, but
              also that it accurately reflects the TSFI by taking into
              account other information about the interface, such as
              the description of the parameters; this can be done in
              association with other work units for this

      If an action available through an interface plays a role in
      enforcing any security policy on the TOE (that is, if one of the
      actions of the interface can be traced to one of the SFRs levied
      on the TSF), then that interface is
      <italic>SFR-enforcing</italic>. Such policies are not limited to
      the access control policies, but also refer to any functionality
      specified by one of the SFRs contained in the ST. Note that it

      results, some of which may be SFR-enforcing and some of which
      may not.</para>

              for the security policies of the TOE to be preserved,
              are termed <italic>SFR supporting</italic>. Interfaces

            <para type="normal">
              It should be noted that in order for an interface to be
              SFR supporting or SFR non-interfering it must have
              <italic>no</italic> SFR-enforcing actions or results. In
              contrast, an SFR-enforcing interface may have
              SFR-supporting actions (for example, the ability to set
              the system clock may be an SFR-enforcing action of an
              interface, but if that same interface is used to display
              the system date that action may only be SFR
              supporting). An example of a purely SFR-supporting
              interface is a system call interface that is used both
              by untrusted users and by a portion of the TSF that is
              running in user mode.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              At this level, it is unlikely that a developer will have
              expended effort to label interfaces as SFR-enforcing and
              SFR-supporting.  In the case that this has been done,
              the evaluator should verify to the extent that
              supporting documentation (e.g., operational user
              guidance) allows that this identification is correct.
              Note that this identification activity is necessary for
              several work units for this component.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              In the more likely case that the developer has not
              labelled the interfaces, the evaluator must perform
              their own identification of the interfaces first, and
              then determine whether the required information (for
              this work unit, the purpose) is present.  Again, because
              of the lack of supporting evidence this identification
              will be difficult and have low assurance that all
              appropriate interfaces have been correctly identified,
              but nonetheless the evaluator examines other evidence
              available for the TOE to ensure as complete coverage as
              is possible.</para>

              TSFI, as it may be possible to describe in general how
              kernel calls are invoked, for instance, and then
              identify each interface using that general
              style. Different types of interfaces will require
              different method of use specifications. APIs, network
              protocol interfaces, system configuration parameters,

              TSFI, as it may be possible to describe in general how
              kernel calls are invoked, for instance, and then
              identify each interface using that general
              style. Different types of interfaces will require
              different method of use specifications. APIs, network

              It is the evaluator's responsibility to examine the
              evidence provided by the developer and determine that
              the required information is present.  In the case where

              which interfaces are SFR-enforcing and which are not,
              and subsequently ensure that the SFR-enforcing aspects

              if audit requirements are included in the ST, then
              audit-related actions would be SFR-enforcing and
              therefore must be described, even if the result of that
              action is generally not visible through the invoked

              Errors can take many forms, depending on the interface
              being described. For an API, the interface itself may
              return an error code, set a global error condition, or
              set a certain parameter with an error code. For a
              configuration file, an incorrectly configured parameter
              may cause an error message to be written to a log
              file. For a hardware PCI card, an error condition may
              raise a signal on the bus, or trigger an exception
              condition to the CPU.</para>

              Errors (and the associated error messages) come about
              through the invocation of an interface. The processing
              that occurs in response to the interface invocation may
              encounter error conditions, which trigger (through an
              implementation-specific mechanism) an error message to
              be generated. In some instances this may be a return
              value from the interface itself; in other instances a
              global value may be set and checked after the invocation
              of an interface. It is likely that a TOE will have a
              number of low-level error messages that may result from
              fundamental resource conditions, such as ``disk full''
              or ``resource locked''. While these error messages may
              map to a large number of TSFI, they could be used to
              detect instances where detail from an interface
              description has been omitted. For instance, a TSFI that
              produces a ``disk full'' message, but has no obvious
              description of why that TSFI should cause an access to
              the disk in its description of actions, might cause the

              evaluator also ensures that no interfaces have been
              mis-categorised.  This is done by examining other
              information supplied for the evaluation (e.g., TOE
              design, security architecture description, operational
              user guidance), and the other information presented for
              the interfaces (parameters and parameter descriptions,
              for example) not labelled as SFR-enforcing. The analysis
              done for work units <xref id="adv_fsp.3-7" show="id"/>
              and <xref id="adv_fsp.3-8" show="id"/> are also used in

              same level of information on all interfaces, the
              evaluator performs the same type of analysis mentioned
              in the previous paragraphs.  The evaluator should
              determine which interfaces are SFR-enforcing and which
              are not, and subsequently ensure that the SFR-enforcing
              aspects of the SFR-enforcing actions are appropriately
              described.  Note that in this case, the evaluator should
              be able to perform the bulk of the work associated with

            <para type="normal"> The SFR-enforcing actions are those that are
              visible at any external interface and that provide for
              the enforcement of the SFRs being claimed. For example,
              if audit requirements are included in the ST, then
              audit-related actions would be SFR-enforcing and
              therefore must be described, even if the result of that
              action is generally not visible through the invoked
              interface (as is often the case with audit, where a user
              action at one interface would produce an audit record

              evaluator should keep in mind that the description
              should be detailed enough to support the generation (and
              assessment) of test cases against that interface.  If
              the description is unclear or lacking detail such that
              meaningful testing cannot be conducted against the TSFI,
              it is likely that the description is inadequate.</para>

      The evaluator should note that the requirement and associated
      work unit is that all direct error messages associated with an
      SFR-enforcing TSFI must be described, that are associated with
      SFR-enforcing actions.  This is because at this level of
      assurance, the ``extra'' information provided by the error
      message descriptions should be used in determining whether all
      of the SFR-enforcing aspects of an interface have been
      appropriately described.  For instance, if an error message
      associated with a TSFI (e.g., ``access denied'') indicated that
      an SFR-enforcing decision or action had taken place, but in the
      description of the SFR-enforcing actions there was no mention of
      that particular SFR-enforcing mechanism, then the description
      may not be complete.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              Errors can take many forms, depending on the interface
              being described. For an API, the interface itself may
              return an error code, set a global error condition, or
              set a certain parameter with an error code. For a
              configuration file, an incorrectly configured parameter
              may cause an error message to be written to a log
              file. For a hardware PCI card, an error condition may
              raise a signal on the bus, or trigger an exception
              condition to the CPU.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              Errors (and the associated error messages) come about
              through the invocation of an interface. The processing
              that occurs in response to the interface invocation may
              encounter error conditions, which trigger (through an
              implementation-specific mechanism) an error message to
              be generated. In some instances this may be a return
              value from the interface itself; in other instances a
              global value may be set and checked after the invocation
              of an interface. It is likely that a TOE will have a
              number of low-level error messages that may result from
              fundamental resource conditions, such as ``disk full''
              or ``resource locked''. While these error messages may
              map to a large number of TSFI, they could be used to
              detect instances where detail from an interface
              description has been omitted. For instance, a TSFI that
              produces a ``disk full'' message, but has no obvious
              description of why that TSFI should cause an access to
              the disk in its description of actions, might cause the
              evaluator to examine other evidence (<xref id="adv_arc" show="link"/>, <xref id="adv_tds" show="link"/>) related

      In order to determine that the description of the error messages

      In performing the various work units included in this family,

      completeness of several factors (the TSFI itself, as well as the
      individual components (parameters, actions, error messages,
      etc.) of the TSFI). In doing this analysis, the evaluator is
      expected to use the documentation provided for the
      evaluation. This includes the ST, the TOE design, and may
      include other documentation such as the operational user
      guidance, security architecture description, and implementation
      representation. The documentation should be examined in an
      iterative fashion. The evaluator may read, for example, in the
      TOE design how a certain function is implemented, but see no way
      to invoke that function from the interface. This might cause the
      evaluator to question the completeness of a particular TSFI
      description, or whether an interface has been left out of the

              Errors can take many forms, depending on the interface

              Errors (and the associated error messages) come about
              through the invocation of an interface. The processing
              that occurs in response to the interface invocation may
              encounter error conditions, which trigger (through an
              implementation-specific mechanism) an error message to
              be generated. In some instances this may be a return
              value from the interface itself; in other instances a
              global value may be set and checked after the invocation
              of an interface. It is likely that a TOE will have a
              number of low-level error messages that may result from
              fundamental resource conditions, such as ``disk full''
              or ``resource locked''. While these error messages may
              map to a large number of TSFI, they could be used to
              detect instances where detail from an interface
              description has been omitted. For instance, a TSFI that
              produces a ``disk full'' message, but has no obvious
              description of why that TSFI should cause an access to
              the disk in its description of actions, might cause the
              evaluator to examine other evidence (<xref id="adv_arc" show="link"/>, <xref id="adv_tds" show="link"/>) related

              Errors can take many forms, depending on the interface
              being described. For an API, the interface itself may
              return an error code; set a global error condition, or
              set a certain parameter with an error code. For a
              configuration file, an incorrectly configured parameter
              may cause an error message to be written to a log
              file. For a hardware PCI card, an error condition may
              raise a signal on the bus, or trigger an exception
              condition to the CPU.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              Errors (and the associated error messages) come about
              through the invocation of an interface. The processing
              that occurs in response to the interface invocation may
              encounter error conditions, which trigger (through an
              implementation-specific mechanism) an error message to
              be generated. In some instances this may be a return
              value from the interface itself; in other instances a
              global value may be set and checked after the invocation
              of an interface. It is likely that a TOE will have a
              number of low-level error messages that may result from
              fundamental resource conditions, such as ``disk full''
              or ``resource locked''. While these error messages may
              map to a large number of TSFI, they could be used to
              detect instances where detail from an interface
              description has been omitted. For instance, a TSFI that
              produces a ``disk full'' message, but has no obvious
              description of why that TSFI should cause an access to
              the disk in its description of actions, might cause the
              evaluator to examine other evidence (<xref id="adv_arc" show="id"/>, <xref id="adv_tds" show="id"/>) related

              The evaluator determines that, for each TSFI, the exact
              set of error messages that can be returned on invoking
              that interface can be determined. The evaluator reviews
              the evidence provided for the interface to determine if
              the set of errors seems complete. They cross-check this
              information with other evidence provided for the
              evaluation (e.g., TOE design, security architecture
              description, operational user guidance, implementation
              representation) to ensure that there are no errors
              steaming from processing mentioned that are not included

              In order to determine accuracy, the evaluator must be

              evaluator would not be able to understand the error if
              the functional specification only listed: ``possible
              errors resulting from invocation of the
              <italic>foo()</italic> interface are 0, 1, or
              2''. Instead the evaluator checks to ensure that the
              errors are described such as: ``possible errors
              resulting from invocation of the <italic>foo()</italic>
              interface are 0 (processing successful), 1 (file not

              potential error conditions that might be caused by using
              such an interface are accounted for. The evaluator also

              practises. For example, a case statement that defines

          its design and to provide a basis for analysis in other
          areas of the evaluation (e.g., the search for
          vulnerabilities). The implementation representation is
          expected to be in a form that captures the detailed internal
          workings of the TSF. This may be software source code,

          implementation representation must be made available to the
          evaluator, this does not imply that the evaluator needs to
          possess that representation. For instance, the developer may
          require that the evaluator review the implementation
          representation at a site of the developer's choosing.</para>

          The entire implementation representation is made available

          activities are being performed. This is likely impractical
          in almost all cases, in addition to the fact that it most
          likely will not result in a higher-assurance TOE
          vs. targeted sampling of the implementation
          representation. The implementation representation is made
          available to allow analysis of other TOE design
          decompositions (e.g., functional specification, TOE design),
          and to gain confidence that the security functionality
          described at a higher level in the design actually appear to
          be implemented in the TOE. Conventions in some forms of the
          implementation representation may make it difficult or
          impossible to determine from just the implementation
          representation itself what the actual result of the
          compilation or run-time interpretation will be. For example,
          compiler directives for C language compilers will cause the
          compiler to exclude or include entire portions of the
          code. For this reason, it is important that such ``extra''
          information or related tools (scripts, compilers, etc.)  be
          provided so that the implementation representation can be
          accurately determined.</para>

          The purpose of the mapping between the implementation
          representation and the TOE design description is to aid the
          evaluator's analysis. The internal workings of the TOE may
          be better understood when the TOE design is analysed with
          corresponding portions of the implementation representation.
          The mapping serves as an index into the implementation
          representation. At the lower component, only a subset of the
          implementation representation is mapped to the TOE design
          description. Because of the uncertainty of which portions of
          the implementation representation will need such a mapping,
          the developer may choose either to map the entire
          implementation representation beforehand, or to wait to see
          which portions of the implementation representation the
          evaluator requires to be mapped.</para>

          The implementation representation is manipulated by the
          developer in a form that is suitable for transformation to
          the actual implementation. For instance, the developer may
          work with files containing source code, which is eventually
          compiled to become part of the TSF. The developer makes
          available the implementation representation in the form used
          by the developer, so that the evaluator may use automated
          techniques in the analysis. This also increases the
          confidence that the implementation representation examined
          is actually the one used in the production of the TSF (as
          opposed to the case where it is supplied in an alternate
          presentation format, such as a word processor document). It
          should be noted that other forms of the implementation
          representation may also be used by the developer; these
          forms are supplied as well. The overall goal is to supply
          the evaluator with the information that will maximise the
          effectiveness of the evaluator's analysis efforts.</para>

          Some forms of the implementation representation may require
          additional information because they introduce significant
          barriers to understanding and analysis. Examples include
          ``shrouded'' source code or source code that has been
          obfuscated in other ways such that it prevents understanding
          and/or analysis. These forms of implementation
          representation typically result from the TOE developer
          taking a version of the implementation representation and
          running a shrouding or obfuscation program on it. While the
          shrouded representation is what is compiled and may be
          closer to the implementation (in terms of structure) than
          the original, un-shrouded representation, supplying such
          obfuscated code may cause significantly more time to be
          spent in analysis tasks involving the representation. When
          such forms of representation are created, the components
          require details on the shrouding tools/algorithms used so
          that the un-shrouded representation can be supplied, and the
          additional information can be used to gain confidence that
          the shrouding process does not compromise any security
          functionality.</para>

          This family addresses the assessment of the internal
          structure of the TSF. A TSF whose internals are
          well-structured is easier to implement and less likely to
          contain flaws that could lead to vulnerabilities; it is also
          easier to maintain without the introduction of flaws.</para>

          The internal structure of the TSF can aid or hamper
          understandability of the implementation representation.
          Source code that conforms to coding standards, that exhibit
          a minimum of interactions, and that is written in modules
          each with a single purpose, is much easier to understand

          The components in this family are levelled on the basis of
          the amount of structure and minimisation of complexity
          required.  <xref id="adv_int.1" show="link"/> places
          requirements for well-structured internals on only selected
          parts of the TSF. This component is not included in an EAL
          because this component is viewed for use in special
          circumstances (e.g., the sponsor has a specific concern
          regarding a cryptographic module, which is isolated from the
          rest of the TSF) and would not be widely applicable.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          At the next level, the requirements for well-structured
          internals are placed on the entire TSF. Finally,
          minimisation of complexity is introduced in the highest
          component.</para>

      <af-application-notes>
        <para type="normal">
          These requirements, when applied to the internal structure
          of the TSF, typically result in improvements that aid both
          the developer and the evaluator in understanding the TSF,
          and also provide the basis for designing and evaluating test
          suites. Further, improving understandability of the TSF
          should assist the developer in simplifying its
          maintainability.</para>

          The requirements in this family are presented at a fairly
          abstract level. The wide variety of TOEs makes it impossible
          to codify anything more specific than ``well-structured'' or
          ``minimum complexity''. Judgements on structure and
          complexity are expected to be derived from the specific
          technologies used in the TOE. For example, software is
          likely to be considered well-structured if it exhibits the
          characteristics cited in the software engineering
          disciplines. The components within this family call for
          identifying the standards for measuring the characteristic
          of being well-structured and not overly-complex.</para>

            design (see <xref id="adv_tds" show="id"/>), the

          Inadequacies in a TOE can result either from a failure in
          understanding the security requirements or from a flawed
          implementation of those security requirements. Defining the
          security requirements adequately to ensure their
          understanding may be problematic because the definition must
          be sufficiently precise to prevent undesired results or
          subtle flaws during implementation of the TOE. Throughout
          the design, implementation, and review processes, the
          modelled security requirements may be used as precise design
          and implementation guidance, thereby providing increased
          assurance that the modelled security requirements are
          satisfied by the TOE. The precision of the model and
          resulting guidance is significantly improved by casting the
          model in a formal language and verifying the security
          requirements by formal proof.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          The creation of a formal security policy model helps to
          identify and eliminate ambiguous, inconsistent,
          contradictory, or unenforceable security policy
          elements. Once the TOE has been built, the formal model
          serves the evaluation effort by contributing to the
          evaluator's judgement of how well the developer has
          understood the security functionality being implemented and
          whether there are inconsistencies between the security
          requirements and the TOE design. The confidence in the model
          is accompanied by a proof that it contains no
          inconsistencies.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          A formal security model is a precise formal presentation of
          the important aspects of security and their relationship to
          the behaviour of the TOE; it identifies the set of rules and
          practises that regulates how the TSF manages, protects, and
          otherwise controls the system resources. The model includes
          the set of restrictions and properties that specify how
          information and computing resources are prevented from being
          used to violate the SFRs, accompanied by a persuasive set of
          engineering arguments showing that these restrictions and
          properties play a key role in the enforcement of the SFRs.
          It consists both of the formalisms that express the security
          functionality, as well as ancillary text to explain the
          model and to provide it with context. The security behaviour
          of the TSF is modelled both in terms of external behaviour
          (i.e. how the TSF interacts with the rest of the TOE and
          with its operational environment), as well as its internal
          behaviour.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          The Security Policy Model of the TOE is informally
          abstracted from its realisation by considering the proposed
          security requirements of the ST. The informal abstraction is
          taken to be successful if the TOE's principles (also termed
          ``invariants'') turn out to be enforced by its
          characteristics. The purpose of formal methods lies within
          the enhancement of the rigour of enforcement. Informal
          arguments are always prone to fallacies; especially if
          relationships among subjects, objects and operations get
          more and more involved. In order to minimise the risk of
          insecure state arrivals the rules and characteristics of the
          security policy model are mapped to respective properties
          and features within some formal system, whose rigour and
          strength can afterwards be used to obtain the security
          properties by means of theorems and formal proof.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          While the term ``formal security policy model'' is used in
          academic circles, the CC's approach has no fixed definition
          of ``security''; it would equate to whatever SFRs are being
          claimed. Therefore, the formal security policy model is
          merely a formal representation of the set of SFRs being
          claimed.</para>

          The term <italic>security policy</italic> has

          user-based (discretionary access control). However, a
          security policy is not limited to access control; there are
          also audit policies, identification policies, authentication
          policies, encryption policies, management policies, and any

          The goal of design documentation is to provide sufficient
          information to determine the TSF boundary, and to describe
          <italic>how</italic> the TSF implements the Security
          Functional Requirements. The amount and structure of the
          design documentation will depend on the complexity of the
          TOE and the number of SFRs; in general, a very complex TOE
          with a large number of SFRs will require more design
          documentation than a very simple TOE implementing only a few
          SFRs. Very complex TOEs will benefit (in terms of the
          assurance provided) from the production of differing levels
          of decomposition in describing the design, while very simple
          TOEs do not require both high-level and low-level
          descriptions of its implementation.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          This family uses two levels of decomposition: the
          <italic>subsystem</italic> and the <italic>module</italic>.
          A module is the most specific description of functionality:
          it is a description of the implementation. A developer
          should be able to implement the part of the TOE described by
          the module with no further design decisions. A subsystem is
          a description of the design of the TOE; it helps to provide
          a high-level description of what a portion of the TOE is
          doing and how. As such, a subsystem may be further divided
          into lower-level subsystems, or into modules.  Very complex
          TOEs might require several levels of subsystems in order to
          adequately convey a useful description of how the TOE works.
          Very simple TOEs, in contrast, might not require a subsystem
          level of description; the module might clearly describe how
          the TOE works.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          The general approach adopted for design documentation is
          that, as the level of assurance increases, the emphasis of
          description shifts from the general (subsystem level) to
          more (module level) detail.  In cases where a module-level
          of abstraction is appropriate because the TOE is simple
          enough to be described at the module level, yet the level of
          assurance calls for a subsystem level of description, the
          module-level description alone will suffice. For complex
          TOEs, however, this is not the case: an enormous amount of
          (module-level) detail would be incomprehensible without an
          accompanying subsystem level of description.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          This approach follows the general paradigm that providing
          additional detail about the implementation of the TSF will
          result in greater assurance that the SFRs are implemented
          correctly, and provide information that can be used to

            <para type="normal">
              The first aspect of accuracy is that each TSFI is mapped
              to a subsystem at the TSF boundary. This determination
              can be made by reviewing the subsystem description and
              interactions, and from this information determining its
              place in the architecture. The next aspect of accuracy
              is that the mapping makes sense. For instance, mapping a
              TSFI dealing with access control to a subsystem that
              checks passwords is not accurate. The evaluator should
              again use judgement in making this determination. The
              goal is that this information aids the evaluator in
              understanding the system and implementation of the SFRs,
              and ways in which entities at the TSF boundary can
              interact with the TSF. The bulk of the assessment of
              whether the SFRs are described accurately by the
              subsystems is performed in other work units.</para>

              subsystems. Such subsystems should be referenced by the
              descriptions of the SFR-enforcing subsystems, as well as
              by the descriptions of interactions in work unit <xref id="adv_tds.2-7" show="link"/>.  The goal of evaluator's
              assessment, like that for the previous work unit, is
              two-fold.  First, it should provide the evaluator with
              an understanding of the way each SFR-supporting
              subsystem works.  Second, the evaluator determines that
              the behaviour is described in enough detail so that the
              way in which the subsystem supports the SFR-enforcing
              behaviour is clear, and that the behaviour is not itself
              SFR-enforcing.  The information provided for
              SFR-supporting subsystem's behaviour does not have to be
              as detailed as that provided by the SFR-enforcing
              behaviour.  For example, data structures or data items
              that do not pertain to SFR-enforcing functionality will
              likely not need to be described in detail, if at all.
              It is the evaluator's determination, however, with
              respect to what ``high-level'' means for a particular
              TOE, and the evaluator obtains enough information from
              the developer (even if it turns out to be equivalent to
              information provided for the parts of the subsystem that
              are SFR-enforcing) to make a sound verdict for this work
              unit.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              The evaluator is cautions, however, that ``perfect''
              assurance is not a goal nor required by this work unit,
              so judgement will have to be exercised in determine the
              amount and composition of the evidence required to make
              a verdict on this work unit.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              To determine completeness and accuracy, the evaluator
              examines other information available (e.g., functional
              specification, security architecture description,
              implementation representation).  Descriptions of
              functionality in these documents should be consistent
              with what is provided for evidence for this work unit.
              In particular, the functional specification should be
              used to determine that the behaviour required to
              implement the TSF Interfaces described by the functional
              specification are completely described by the
              subsystem.</para>

            <para type="normal">
      The goal of describing the interactions between the subsystems
      is to help provide the reader a better understanding of how the
      TSF performs it functions. These interactions do not need to be
      characterised at the implementation level (e.g., parameters
      passed from one routine in a subsystem to a routine in a
      different subsystem; global variables; hardware signals (e.g.,
      interrupts) from a hardware subsystem to an interrupt-handling
      subsystem), but the data elements identified for a particular
      subsystem that are going to be used by another subsystem need to
      be covered in this discussion.  Any control relationships
      between subsystems (e.g., a subsystem responsible for
      configuring a rule base for a firewall system and the subsystem
      that actually implements these rules) should also be
      described.</para>
            <para type="normal">
      It should be noted while the developer should characterise all
      interactions between subsystems, the evaluators need to use
      their own judgement in assessing the completeness of the
      description. If the reason for an interaction is unclear, or if
      there are SFR-related interactions (discovered, for instance, in
      examining the descriptions of subsystem behaviour) that do not
      appear to be described, the evaluator ensures that this
      information is provided by the developer. However, if the
      evaluator can determine that interactions among a particular set
      of subsystems, while incompletely described by the developer,
      will not aid in understanding the overall functionality nor
      security functionality provided by the TSF, then the evaluator
      may choose to consider the description sufficient, and not
      pursue completeness for its own sake.</para>

              SFR-enforcing portions of the TSF, and at a higher level
              for other portions of the TSF. The TSFI provide a
              description of how the implementation is exercised. The
              evidence from the developer identifies the subsystem
              that is initially involved when an operation is
              requested at the TSFI, and identify the various
              subsystems that are primarily responsible for
              implementing the functionality. Note that a complete

              The evaluator assesses the completeness of the mapping

              complex.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              The first aspect of accuracy is that each TSFI is mapped
              to a subsystem at the TSF boundary. This determination
              can be made by reviewing the subsystem description and
              interactions, and from this information determining its
              place in the architecture. The next aspect of accuracy
              is that the mapping makes sense. For instance, mapping a
              TSFI dealing with access control to a subsystem that
              checks passwords is not accurate. The evaluator should
              again use judgement in making this determination. The
              goal is that this information aids the evaluator in
              understanding the system and implementation of the SFRs,
              and ways in which entities at the TSF boundary can
              interact with the TSF. The bulk of the assessment of

              in-depth knowledge or understanding of the TOE design or
              by work done in the previous work unit. Note that this

      There are three types of activity that the evaluator must
      undertake with respect to the TOE design. First, the evaluator
      determines that the TSF boundary has been adequately
      described. Second, the evaluator determines that the developer
      has provided documentation that conforms to the content and
      presentation requirements for this subsystem, and that is
      consistent with other documentation provided for the
      TOE. Finally, the evaluator must analyse the design information
      provided for the SFR-enforcing modules (at a detailed level) and
      the SFR-supporting and SFR-non-interfering  modules (at a less detailed level) to
      understand how the system is implemented, and with that
      knowledge ensure that the TSFI in the functional specification
      are adequately described, and that the test information
      adequately tests the TSF (done in the <xref id="ate" show="link"/> work units).</para>
          <para type="normal">
      It is important to note that while the developer is obligated to
      provide a complete description of the TSF (although
      SFR-enforcing modules will have more detail than the
      SFR-supporting or SFR-non-interfering modules), the evaluator is
      expected to use their judgement in performing their
      analysis. While the evaluator is expected to look at every
      module, the detail to which they examine each module may
      vary. The evaluator analyses each module in order to gain enough
      understanding to determine the effect of the functionality of
      the module on the security of the system, and the depth to which
      they need to analyse the module may vary depending on the
      module's role in the system. An important aspect of this
      analysis is that the evaluator should use the other
      documentation provided (TSS, functional specification, security
      architecture description, and the TSF internal document) in
      order to determine that the functionality that is described is
      correct, and that the implicit designation of SFR-supporting or
      SFR-non-interfering modules (see below) is supported by their
      role in the system architecture.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              The developer may designate modules as SFR-enforcing,
              SFR-supporting, and SFR non-interfering, but these
              ``tags'' are used only to describe the amount and type
              of information the developer must provide, and can be
              used to limit the amount of information the developer
              has to develop if their engineering process does not
              produce the documentation required. Whether the
              modules have been categorised by the developer or
              not, it is the
              evaluator's responsibility to determine that the
              modules have the appropriate information for their
              role (SFR-enforcing, etc.) in the TOE, and to obtain the
              appropriate information from the developer should the
              developer fail to provide the required information for a
              particular module.</para>

            <para type="normal">
      In the cases where the developer has provided different amounts
      of information for different modules, an implicit categorisation
      has been done. That is, modules (for instance) with detail
      presented on their SFR-related interfaces (see <xref id="adv_tds.3.10c" show="link"/>) are candidate SFR-enforcing
      modules, although examination by the evaluator may lead to a
      determination that some set of them are SFR-supporting or
      SFR-non-interfering. Those with only a description of their
      purpose and interaction with other modules (for instance) are
      ``implicitly categorised'' as SFR-supporting or
      SFR-non-interfering.</para>
            <para type="normal">
      In these cases, a key focus of the evaluator for this work unit
      is attempting to determine from the evidence provided for each
      module implicitly categorised as SFR-supporting or
      SFR-non-interfering and the evaluation information about other
      modules (in the TOE design, the functional specification, the
      security architecture description, and the operational user
      guidance), whether the module is indeed SFR-supporting or
      SFR-non-interfering. At this level of assurance some error
      should be tolerated; the evaluator does not have to be
      absolutely sure that a given module is SFR-supporting or
      SFR-non-interfering, even though it is labelled as
      such. However, if the evidence provided indicates that a
      SFR-supporting or SFR-non-interfering module is SFR-enforcing,
      the evaluator requests additional information from the developer
      in order to resolve the apparent inconsistency. For instance,
      suppose the documentation for Module A (an SFR-enforcing module)
      indicates that it calls Module B to perform an access check on a
      certain type of construct. When the evaluator examines the
      information associated with Module B, they find that all the
      developer has provided is a purpose and a set of interactions
      (thus implicitly categorising Module B as SFR-supporting or
      SFR-non-interfering). On examining the purpose and interactions
      from Module A, the evaluator finds no mention of Module B
      performing any access checks, and Module A is not listed as a
      module with which Module B interacts. At this point the
      evaluator should approach the developer to resolve the
      discrepancies between the information provided in Module A and
      that in Module B.</para>
            <para type="normal">
      Another example would be where the evaluator examines the
      mapping of the TSFI to the modules as provided by <xref id="adv_tds.3.2d" show="link"/>. This examination shows that
      Module C is associated with an SFR requiring identification of
      the user. Again, when the evaluator examines the information
      associated with Module C, they find that all the developer has
      provided is a purpose and a set of interactions (thus implicitly
      categorising Module C as SFR-supporting or
      SFR-non-interfering). Examining the purpose and interactions
      presented for Module C, the evaluator is unable to determine why
      Module C, listed as mapping to a TSFI concerned with user
      identification, would not be classified as SFR-enforcing. Again,
      the evaluator should approach the developer to resolve this
      discrepancy.</para>
  
            <para type="normal">
      A final example is from the opposite point of view. As
      before, the developer has provided information associated
      with Module D consisting of a purpose and a set of
      interactions (thus implicitly categorising Module D as
      SFR-supporting or SFR-non-interfering). The evaluator
      examines all of the evidence provided, including the purpose
      and interactions for Module D. The purpose appears to give a
      meaningful description of Module D's function in the TOE,
      the interactions are consistent with that description, and
      there is nothing to indicate that Module D is
      SFR-enforcing. In this case, the evaluator should not demand
      more information about Module D ``just be to sure'' it is
      correctly categorised. The developer has met their
      obligations and the resulting assurance the evaluator has in
      the implicit categorisation of Module D is (by definition)
      appropriate for this assurance level.</para>

              The description of the purpose of a module indicates
              what function the module is fulfilling.  From the
              description, the evaluator should be able to obtain a
              general idea of the module's role. In order to assure
              the description is complete, the evaluator uses the
              information provided about the module's interactions
              with other modules to assess whether the reasons for the
              module being called are consistent with the module's
              purpose. If the interaction description contains
              functionality that is not apparent from, or in conflict
              with, the module's purpose, the evaluator needs to
              determine whether the problem is one of accuracy or of
              completeness. The evaluator should be wary of purposes
              that are too short, since meaningful analysis based on a
              one-sentence purpose is likely to be impossible.</para>

       However, the evaluator uses the information present in those documents
       to the extent possible to help ensure that the function is accurately
       and completely described. This analysis can be aided by the analysis

      The modules described in the TOE design provide a description of
      the implementation of the TSF. The TSFI provide a description of
      how the implementation is exercised. The evidence from the
      developer identifies the module that is initially invoked when
      an operation is requested at the TSFI, and identifies the chain
      of modules invoked up to the module that is primarily
      responsible for implementing the functionality. However, a
      complete call tree for each TSFI is not required for this work
      unit. The cases in which more than one module would have to be
      identified are where there are ``entry point'' modules or
      wrapper modules that have no functionality other than
      conditioning inputs or de-multiplexing an input. Mapping to one
      of these modules would not provide any useful information to the
      evaluator.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              The evaluator assesses the completeness of the mapping
              by ensuring that all of the TSFI map to at least one
              module. The verification of accuracy is more
              complex.</para>
            <para type="normal">
       The first aspect of accuracy is that each TSFI is mapped to a module at the TSF boundary.
       This determination can be made by reviewing the module description and its
       interfaces/interactions. The next aspect of accuracy is that each TSFI identifies
       a chain of modules between the initial module identified and a module
       that is primarily responsible for implementing the function presented at the TSF.
       Note that this may be the initial module, or there may be several modules,
       depending on how much pre-conditioning of the inputs is done. It should be noted that
       one indicator of a pre-conditioning module is that it is invoked for a large number
       of the TSFI, where the TSFI are all of similar type (e.g., system call).
       The final aspect of accuracy is that the mapping makes sense. For instance,
       mapping a TSFI dealing with access control to a module that checks passwords
       is not accurate. The evaluator should again use judgement in making this determination.
       The goal is that this information aids the evaluator in understanding the system and
       implementation of the SFRs, and ways in which entities at the TSF boundary can interact
       with the TSF. The bulk of the assessment of whether the SFRs are described accurately
       by the modules is performed in other work units.</para>

              The evaluator shall examine the TOE design to determine

              SFR-enforcing and SFR-supporting module contain an
              accurate and complete description of the SFR-related

            <para type="normal">
              The SFR-related interfaces of a module are those
              interfaces used by other modules as a means to invoke
              the SFR-related operations provided, and to provide
              inputs to or receive outputs from the module. The
              purpose in the specification of these interfaces is to
              permit the exercise of them during testing.
              Inter-module interfaces that are not SFR-related need
              not be specified or described, since they are not a
              factor in testing.  Likewise, other internal interfaces
              that are not a factor in traversing SFR-related paths of
              execution (such as those internal paths that are
              fixed).</para><para type="normal">
	SFR-related interfaces of SFR-supporting modules are all
	interfaces of SFR-supporting modules that are called directly
	or indirectly from SFR-enforcing modules. Those interfaces
	need to be described with all the parameter used in such a
	call. This allows the evaluator to understand the purpose of
	the call to the SFR-supporting module in the context of
	operation of the SFR-enforcing modules.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              SFR-related interfaces are described in terms of how
              they are invoked, and any values that are returned. This
              description would include a list of parameters, and
              descriptions of these parameters. Note that global data
              would also be considered parameters if used by the
              module (either as inputs or outputs) when invoked. If a
              parameter were expected to take on a set of values
              (e.g., a ``flag'' parameter), the complete set of values
              the parameter could take on that would have an effect on
              module processing would be specified. Likewise,
              parameters representing data structures are described
              such that each field of the data structure is identified
              and described. Note that different programming languages
              may have additional ``interfaces'' that would be
              non-obvious; an example would be operator/function
              overloading in C++. This ``implicit interface'' in the
              class description would also be described as part of the
              low-level TOE design. Note that although a module could
              present only one interface, it is more common that a
              module presents a small set of related
              interfaces.</para>
            <para type="normal">
          In terms of the assessment of parameters (inputs and
          outputs) to a module, any use of global data must also
          be considered. A module ``uses'' global data if it
          either reads or writes the data. In order to assure the
          description of such parameters (if used) is complete,
          the evaluator uses other information provided about the
          module in the TOE design (interfaces, algorithmic
          description, etc.), as well as the description of the
          particular set of global data assessed in work unit
          <xref id="adv_tds.4-12" show="link"/>. For instance, the
          evaluator could first determine the processing the
          module performs by examining its function and interfaces
          presented (particularly the parameters of the
          interfaces). They could then check to see if the
          processing appears to ``touch'' any of the global data
          areas identified in the TDS design. The evaluator then
          determines that, for each global data area that appears
          to be ``touched'', that global data area is listed as a
          means of input or output by the module the evaluator is
          examining.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              Invocation conventions are a programming-reference-type
              description that one could use to correctly invoke a
              module's interface if one were writing a program to make
              use of the module's functionality through that
              interface. This includes necessary inputs and outputs,
              including any set-up that may need to be performed with
              respect to global variables.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              Values returned through the interface refer to values
              that are either passed through parameters or messages;
              values that the function call itself returns in the
              style of a ``C'' program function call; or values passed
              through global means (such as certain error routines in
              *ix-style operating systems).</para>
            <para type="normal">
              In order to assure the description is complete, the
              evaluator uses other information provided about the
              module in the TOE design (e.g., algorithmic description,
              global data used) to ensure that it appears all data
              necessary for performing the functions of the module is
              presented to the module, and that any values that other
              modules expect the module under examination to provide
              are identified as being returned by the module. The
              evaluator determines accuracy by ensuring that the
              description of the processing matches the information
              listed as being passed to or from an interface.</para>

              The evaluator shall examine the TOE design to determine
              that SFR-non-interfering modules are correctly
              categorised.</para>
            <para type="normal">
      As mentioned in work unit <xref id="adv_tds.4-2" show="link"/>,
      less information is required about modules that are
      SFR-non-interfering.  A key focus of the evaluator for this work
      unit is attempting to determine from the evidence provided for
      each module implicitly categorised as SFR-non-interfering and
      the evaluation (information about other modules in the TOE
      design, the functional specification, the security architecture
      description, the operational user guidance, the TSF internals
      document, and perhaps even the implementation representation)
      whether the module is indeed SFR-non-interfering. At this level
      of assurance some error should be tolerated; the evaluator does
      not have to be absolutely sure that a given module is
      SFR-non-interfering, even though it is labelled as
      such. However, if the evidence provided indicates that a
      SFR-non-interfering module is SFR-enforcing or SFR-supporting,
      the evaluator requests additional information from the developer
      in order to resolve the apparent inconsistency. For example,
      suppose the documentation for Module A (an SFR-enforcing module)
      indicates that it calls Module B to perform an access check on a
      certain type of construct. When the evaluator examines the
      information associated with Module B, it is discovered that the
      only information the developer has provided is a purpose and a
      set of interactions (thus implicitly categorising Module B as
      SFR-supporting or SFR-non-interfering). On examining the purpose and interactions
      from Module A, the evaluator finds no mention of Module B
      performing any access checks, and Module A is not listed as a
      module with which Module B interacts. At this point the
      evaluator should approach the developer to resolve the
      discrepancies between the information provided in Module A and
      that in Module B.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              Another example would be where the evaluator examines
              the mapping of the TSFI to the modules as provided by
              <xref id="adv_tds.4.2d" show="link"/>. This examination
              shows that Module C is associated with an SFR requiring
              identification of the user. Again, when the evaluator
              examines the information associated with Module C, they
              find that all the developer has provided is a purpose
              and a set of interactions (thus implicitly categorising
              Module C as SFR-non-interfering). Examining the purpose
              and interactions presented for Module C, the evaluator
              is unable to determine why Module C, listed as mapping
              to a TSFI concerned with user identification, would not
              be classified as SFR-enforcing or SFR-supporting. Again,
              the evaluator should approach the developer to resolve
              this discrepancy.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              A final example illustrates the opposite situation. As
              before, the developer has provided information
              associated with Module D consisting of a purpose and a
              set of interactions (thus implicitly categorising Module
              D as SFR-non-interfering). The evaluator examines all of
              the evidence provided, including the purpose and
              interactions for Module D. The purpose appears to give a
              meaningful description of Module D's function in the
              TOE, the interactions are consistent with that
              description, and there is nothing to indicate that
              Module D is SFR-enforcing or SFR-supporting. In this
              case, the evaluator should not demand more information
              about Module D ``just be to sure'' it is correctly
              categorised. The developer has met the obligations and
              the resulting assurance the evaluator has in the
              implicit categorisation of Module D is (by definition)
              appropriate for this assurance level.</para>

              The description of the purpose of a module indicates
              what function the module is fulfilling. From the

              general idea of the module's role. In order to assure
              the description is complete, the evaluator uses the
              information provided about the module's interactions
              with other modules to assess whether the reasons for the
              module being called are consistent with the module's
              purpose. If the interaction description contains
              functionality that is not apparent from, or in conflict
              with, the module's purpose, the evaluator needs to
              determine whether the problem is one of accuracy or of
              completeness. The evaluator should be wary of purposes
              that are too short, since meaningful analysis based on a

      present in those documents to the extent possible to help ensure
      that the function is accurately and completely described. This
      analysis can be aided by the analysis performed for the work

              The first aspect of accuracy is that each TSFI is mapped
              to a module at the TSF boundary. This determination can
              be made by reviewing the module description and its
              interfaces/interactions. The next aspect of accuracy is
              that each TSFI identifies a chain of modules between the
              initial module identified and a module that is primarily
              responsible for implementing the function presented at
              the TSF. Note that this may be the initial module, or
              there may be several modules, depending on how much
              pre-conditioning of the inputs is done. It should be
              noted that one indicator of a pre-conditioning module is
              that it is invoked for a large number of the TSFI, where
              the TSFI are all of similar type (e.g., system
              call). The final aspect of accuracy is that the mapping
              makes sense. For instance, mapping a TSFI dealing with
              access control to a module that checks passwords is not
              accurate. The evaluator should again use judgement in
              making this determination. The goal is that this
              information aids the evaluator in understanding the
              system and implementation of the SFRs, and ways in which
              entities at the TSF boundary can interact with the
              TSF. The bulk of the assessment of whether the SFRs are

              The evaluator shall examine the TOE design to determine

            <para type="normal">
      The evaluator may construct a map between the TOE security
      functional requirements and the TOE design.  This map will
      likely be from a functional requirement to a set of
      subsystems. Note that this map may have to be at a level of
      detail below the component or even element level of the
      requirements, because of operations (assignments, refinements,
      selections) performed on the functional requirement by the ST
      author.</para>
            <para type="normal">
          As an example, if the ST requirements specified a
          role-based access control mechanism, the evaluator would
          first identify the subsystems, and modules that contribute to this
          mechanism's implementation. This could be done by
          in-depth knowledge or understanding of the TOE design or
          by work done in the previous work unit. Note that this
          trace is only to identify the subsystems, and modules, and is not the
          complete analysis.</para>
            <para type="normal">
          The next step would be to understand what mechanism the
          subsystems, and modules implemented. For instance, if the design
          described an implementation of access control based on
          UNIX-style protection bits, the design would not be an
          accurate instantiation of those access control
          requirements present in the ST example used above. If
          the evaluator could not determine that the mechanism was
          accurately implemented because of a lack of detail, the
          evaluator would have to assess whether all of the
          SFR-enforcing subsystems and modules have been identified, or if

        The guidance documents class provides the requirements for

        describe all relevant aspects for the secure handling of the
        TOE. The class also addresses the possibility of unintended
        incorrect configuration or handling of the TOE.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        In many cases it may be appropriate that guidance is provided

          Operational user guidance refers to written material that is
          intended to be used by all types of users of the TOE in its
          evaluated configuration: end-users, persons responsible for
          maintaining and administering the TOE in a correct manner
          for maximum security, and by others (e.g. programmers) using
          the TOE's external interfaces. Operational user guidance
          describes the security functionality provided by the TSF,
          provides instructions and guidelines (including warnings),
          helps to understand the TSF and includes the
          security-critical information, and the security-critical
          actions required, for its secure use.  Misleading and
          unreasonable guidance should be absent from the guidance
          documentation, and secure procedures for all modes of
          operation should be addressed.  Insecure states should be
          easy to detect.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          The operational user guidance provides a measure of

          application providers and others exercising the external
          interfaces of the TOE will understand the secure operation
          of the TOE and will use it as intended. The evaluation of
          the user guidance includes investigating whether the TOE can
          be used in a manner that is insecure but that the user of
          the TOE would reasonably believe to be secure. The objective
          is to minimise the risk of human or other errors in
          operation that may deactivate, disable, or fail to activate
          security functionality, resulting in an undetected insecure

          Requirements for operational user guidance help ensure that
          all types of users are able to operate the TOE in a secure

          must be clearly explained and illustrated). It should be
          excluded that the TOE can be used in a manner that is
          insecure but that the user of the TOE would reasonably
          believe to be secure. Operational user guidance is the

          able to consistently and effectively protect their
          information.  Second, it needs to explain the user's role in

          always be the case (e.g. the audit log fills up, an

          Configuration management (CM) is one means for increasing
          assurance that the TOE meets the SFRs. CM establishes this
          by requiring discipline and control in the processes of
          refinement and modification of the TOE and the related
          information. CM systems are put in place to ensure the
          integrity of the portions of the TOE that they control, by
          providing a method of tracking any changes, and by ensuring
          that all changes are authorised.</para>

          While it is desired that CM be applied from the early design

          For developers that have separate CM systems for different

          addressed in the criteria.</para>

          Similarly, if parts of the TOE are produced by different

          an overall CM system which is addressed in the criteria.  In

            <para type="normal">
              The TOE may provide a method by which it can be easily

              yet it is feasible that the TOE user could obtain the
              necessary information. On the other hand, if the

              hour, yet TOE users had no way of knowing this or when
              it would be posted, it is infeasible that they would

              hour, yet TOE users had no way of knowing this or when

          A measurable life-cycle model is a model using some
          quantitative valuation (arithmetic parameters and/or
          metrics) of the managed product in order to measure
          development properties of the product. Typical metrics are
          source code complexity metrics, defect density (errors per
          size of code) or mean time to failure. For the security
          evaluation all those metrics are of relevance, which are
          used to increase quality by decreasing the probability of
          faults and thereby in turn increasing assurance in the

          density), which may be combined. The CC does not require the

        <para type="normal">
      While evaluating a PP that is based on one or more certified
      PPs, it may be possible to re-use the fact that these PPs were
      certified. The potential for re-use of the result of a certified
      PP is greater if the PP under evaluation does not add threats,
      OSPs, security objectives and/or security requirements to those
      of the PP that conformance is being claimed to. If the PP under
      evaluation contains much more than the certified PP, re-use may
      not be useful at all.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          The evaluator is allowed to re-use the PP evaluation results
          by doing certain analyses only partially or not at all if
          these analyses or parts thereof were already done as part of
          the PP evaluation. While doing this, the evaluator should
          assume that the analyses in the PP were performed
          correctly.</para>
        <para type="normal">
      An example would be where the PP that conformance is being
      claimed to contains a set of security requirements, and these
      were determined to be internally consistent during its
      evaluation. If the PP under evaluation uses the exact same
      requirements, the consistency analysis does not have to be
      repeated during the PP evaluation. If the PP under evaluation
      adds one or more requirements, or performs operations on these
      requirements, the analysis will have to be repeated. However, it
      may be possible to save work in this consistency analysis by
      using the fact that the original requirements are internally
      consistent. If the original requirements are internally
      consistent, the evaluator only has to determine that:
      <list type="enumerated"><item>
          the set of all new and/or changed requirements is internally
          consistent, and
        </item><item>

          with the original requirements.
        </item></list></para>

          While evaluating an ST that is based on one or more

          these PPs were certified. The potential for re-use of the

          threats, OSPs, assumptions, security objectives and/or
          security requirements to those of the PP. If the ST
          contains much more than the certified PP, re-use may not be

        <para type="normal">
          The evaluator is allowed to re-use the PP evaluation results

          assume that the analyses in the PP were performed
          correctly.</para>

          An example would be where the PP contains a set of security
          requirements, and these were determined to be internally
          consistent during the PP evaluation. If the ST uses the
          exact same requirements, the consistency analysis does not
          have to be repeated during the ST evaluation. If the ST adds
          one or more requirements, or performs operations on these
          requirements, the analysis will have to be
          repeated. However, it may be possible to save work in this
          consistency analysis by using the fact that the original

        The emphasis in this class is on confirmation that the TSF

        The goal of this activity is to determine whether the TOE
        behaves as described in the ST and as specified in the
        evaluation evidence (described in the <xref id="adv" show="id"/> class). This determination is achieved through
        some combination of the developer's own functional testing of
        the TSF (<xref id="ate_fun" show="link"/>) and independent
        testing the TSF by the evaluator (<xref id="ate_ind" show="link"/>). At the lowest level of assurance, there is no
        requirement for developer involvement, so the only testing is
        conducted by the evaluator, using the limited available
        information about the TOE. Additional assurance is gained as
        the developer becomes increasingly involved both in testing
        and in providing additional information about the TOE, and as
        the evaluator increases the independent testing
        activities.</para>
    </ma-introduction>
    <ma-application-notes>
      <para type="normal">
        Testing of the TSF is conducted by the evaluator and, in most
        cases, by the developer. The evaluator's testing efforts
        consist not only of creating and running original tests, but
        also of assessing the adequacy of the developer's tests and
        re-running a subset of them.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        The evaluator analyses the developer's tests to determine the
        extent to which they are sufficient to demonstrate that TSFI
        (see <xref id="adv_fsp" show="link"/>) perform as specified,
        and to understand the developer's approach to
        testing. Similarly, the evaluator analyses the developer's
        tests to determine the extent to which they are sufficient to
        demonstrate the internal behaviour and properties of the
        TSF.</para>
      <para type="normal"> The evaluator also executes a subset of the developer's
        tests as documented to gain confidence in the developer's test
        results: the evaluator will use the results of this analysis
        as an input to independently testing a subset of the TSF. With
        respect to this subset, the evaluator takes a testing approach
        that is different from that of the developer, particularly if
        the developer's tests have shortcomings.</para>
      <para type="normal">
      To determine the adequacy of developer's test documentation or
      to create new tests, the evaluator needs to understand the
      desired expected behaviour of the TSF, both internally and as
      seen at the TSFI, in the context of the SFRs it is to
      satisfy. The evaluator may choose to divide the TSF and TSFI
      into subsets according to functional areas of the ST (audit
      subsystem, audit-related TSFI, authentication module,
      authentication-related TSFI, etc.) if they were not already
      divided in the ST, and focus on one subset of the TSF and TSFI
      at a time, examining the ST requirement and the relevant parts
      of the development and guidance documentation to gain an
      understanding of the way the TOE is expected to behave.  This
      reliance upon the development documentation underscores the need
      for the dependencies on <xref id="adv" show="id"/> by <xref id="ate_cov" show="link"/> and <xref id="ate_dpt" show="link"/>.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        The CC has separated coverage and depth from functional tests
        to increase the flexibility when applying the components of
        the families. However, the requirements of the families are
        intended to be applied together to confirm that the TSF
        operates according to its specification. This tight coupling
        of families has led to some duplication of evaluator work
        units across sub-activities. These application notes are used
        to minimise duplication of text between sub-activities.</para>

        <para type="normal">
          Before the adequacy of test documentation can be accurately
          evaluated, or before new tests can be created, the evaluator

          security function in the context of the requirements it is
          to satisfy.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          As mentioned earlier, the evaluator may choose to subset the
          TSF and TSFI according to SFRs (audit, authentication, etc.)
          in the ST and focus on one subset at a time. The evaluator

          With an understanding of the expected behaviour, the

          the testing approach. In most cases, the testing approach
          will entail a TSFI being stimulated and its responses
          observed. Externally-visible functionality can be tested
          directly; however, in cases where functionality is not
          visible external to the TOE (for example, testing the

          In cases where it is impractical or inadequate to test
          specific functionality (where it provides no
          externally-visible TSFI), the test plan should identify the
          alternate approach to verify expected behaviour. It is the
          evaluator's responsibility to determine the suitability of
          the alternate approach. However, the following should be
          considered when assessing the suitability of alternate
          approaches:
          <list type="enumerated">
            <item>
              an analysis of the implementation representation to
              determine that the required behaviour should be
              exhibited by the TOE is an acceptable alternate
              approach. This could mean a code inspection for a
              software TOE or perhaps a chip mask inspection for a
              hardware TOE.
            </item>
            <item>
              it is acceptable to use evidence of developer
              integration or module testing, even if the claimed
              assurance requirements do not include availability of
              lower level descriptions of the TOE modules (e.g. <xref id="adv_tds.3" show="link"/>) or implementation (<xref id="adv_imp" show="link"/>). If evidence of developer
              integration or module testing is used in verifying the
              expected behaviour of a security functionality, care
              should be given to confirm that the testing evidence
              reflects the current implementation of the TOE. If the
              subsystems or modules have been changed since testing
              occurred, evidence that the changes were tracked and
              addressed by analysis or further testing will usually be
              required.

          It should be emphasised that supplementing the testing
          effort with alternate approaches should only be undertaken

          behaviour.</para>

          ordering in cases where the completion of one test
          establishes the necessary pre-requisites for another
          test. The evaluator must determine that the pre-requisites

          evaluator must determine that the test steps and expected

          This family deals with the degree to which there is
          independent functional testing of the TSF. Independent
          functional testing may take the form of repeating the
          developer's functional tests (in whole or in part) or of
          extending the scope or the depth of the developer's
          tests. These activities are complementary, and an
          appropriate mix must be planned for each TOE, which takes
          into account the availability and coverage of test results,
          and the functional complexity of the TSF.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          Sampling of developer tests is intended to provide
          confirmation that the developer has carried out his planned
          test programme on the TSF, and has correctly recorded the
          results. The size of sample selected will be influenced by
          the detail and quality of the developer's functional test
          results. The evaluator will also need to consider the scope
          for devising additional tests, and the relative benefit that
          may be gained from effort in these two areas. It is
          recognised that repetition of all developer tests may be
          feasible and desirable in some cases, but may be very
          arduous and less productive in others. The highest component
          in this family should therefore be used with
          caution. Sampling will address the whole range of test
          results available, including those supplied to meet the
          requirements of both <xref id="ate_cov" show="link"/> and
          <xref id="ate_dpt" show="link"/>.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          There is also a need to consider the different
          configurations of the TOE that are included within the
          evaluation. The evaluator will need to assess the
          applicability of the results provided, and to plan his own
          testing accordingly.</para>
        <para type="normal">
          The suitability of the TOE for testing is based on the
          access to the TOE, and the supporting documentation and
          information required (including any test software or tools)
          to run tests. The need for such support is addressed by the
          dependencies to other assurance families.</para>

          Additionally, suitability of the TOE for testing may be

                  may not be conducive to cost-effective
                  evaluations. Conversely, they are a likely area to
                  find errors and are good candidates for the
                  subset. The evaluator will need to strike a balance

              validity of the developer's test results. The evaluator
              has to decide on the size of the sample, and the
              developer tests that will compose the sample (see <xref id="eval-guidance-sampling" show="link"/>).</para>
            <para type="normal">
              All the developer tests can be traced back to specific
              interfaces. Therefore, the factors to consider in the
              selection of the tests to compose the sample are similar
              to those listed for subset selection in work-unit <xref id="ate_ind.2-6" show="link"/>. Additionally, the
              evaluator may wish to employ a random sampling method to
              select developer tests to include in the sample.</para>

              Inconsistencies between the developer's expected test

              evaluator to resolve the discrepancies. Inconsistencies
              encountered by the evaluator could be resolved by a
              valid explanation and resolution of the inconsistencies

	If a satisfactory explanation or resolution can not be reached,

	<xref id="ate_ind.2-4" show="link"/> is adequately tested: 
	deficiencies with the developer's tests need to result in either 
	corrective action to the TOE by the developer (e.g., if the inconsistency

              The evaluator selects a test subset and testing strategy
              that is appropriate for the TOE. One extreme testing
              strategy would be to have the test subset contain as
              many interfaces as possible tested with little
              rigour. Another testing strategy would be to have the
              test subset contain a few interfaces based on their
              perceived relevance and rigorously test these
              interfaces.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              Typically the testing approach taken by the evaluator
              should fall somewhere between these two extremes. The
              evaluator should exercise most of the interfaces using
              at least one test, but testing need not demonstrate
              exhaustive specification testing.</para>
            <para type="normal">
              The evaluator, when selecting the subset of the
              interfaces to be tested, should consider the following
              factors:
              <list type="enumerated">
                <item>
                  The developer test evidence. The developer test
                  evidence consists of: the test documentation, the
                  available test coverage analysis, and the available
                  depth of testing analysis. The developer test
                  evidence will provide insight as to how the TSF has
                  been exercised by the developer during testing. The
                  evaluator applies this information when developing
                  new tests to independently test the
                  TOE. Specifically the evaluator should consider:
                  <list type="enumerated">
                    <item>
                      augmentation of developer testing for
                      interfaces. The evaluator may wish to perform
                      more of the same type of tests by varying
                      parameters to more rigorously test the
                      interface.

                    <item>
                      supplementation of developer testing strategy
                      for interfaces. The evaluator may wish to vary
                      the testing approach of a specific interface by
                      testing it using another test strategy.

                  The number of interfaces from which to draw upon for
                  the test subset. Where the TSF includes only a small
                  number of relatively simple interfaces, it may be
                  practical to rigorously test all of them. In other
                  cases this may not be cost-effective, and sampling
                  is required.

                  Maintaining a balance of evaluation activities. The
                  evaluator effort expended on the test activity
                  should be commensurate with that expended on any
                  other evaluation activity.

              The evaluator selects the interfaces to compose the
              subset. This selection will depend on a number of
              factors, and consideration of these factors may also
              influence the choice of test subset size:
              <list type="enumerated">
                <item>
                  Rigour of developer testing of the interfaces. Those
                  interfaces that the evaluator determines require
                  additional testing should be included in the test
                  subset.
                </item>
                <item>
                  Developer test results. If the results of developer
                  tests cause the evaluator to doubt that an interface
                  is not properly implemented, then the evaluator
                  should include such interfaces in the test subset.
                </item>
                <item>
                  Significance of interfaces. Those interfaces more
                  significant than others should be included in the
                  test subset. One major factor of ``significance'' is
                  the security-relevance (SFR-enforcing interfaces
                  would be more significant than SFR-supporting
                  interfaces, which are more significant than
                  SFR-non-interfering interfaces; see CC Part 3
                  Subclause <xref id="adv_fsp" show="id"/>). The other
                  major factor of ``significance'' is the number of
                  SFRs mapping to this interface (as determined when
                  identifying the correspondence between levels of
                  abstraction in <xref id="adv" show="id"/>).

                  Complexity of interfaces. Interfaces that require
                  complex implementation may require complex tests
                  that impose onerous requirements on the developer or
                  evaluator, which may not be conducive to
                  cost-effective evaluations. Conversely, they are a
                  likely area to find errors and are good candidates
                  for the subset. The evaluator will need to strike a
                  balance between these considerations.

                  Implicit testing. Testing some interfaces may often
                  implicitly test other interfaces, and their
                  inclusion in the subset may maximise the number of
                  interfaces tested (albeit implicitly). Certain
                  interfaces will typically be used to provide a
                  variety of security functionality, and will tend to
                  be the target of an effective testing approach.

                  strongly in marketing literature and guidance
                  documents, the corresponding interfaces should be

      <para type="normal">
      Generally, the vulnerability assessment activity covers various
      vulnerabilities in the development and operation of the
      TOE. Development vulnerabilities take advantage of some property
      of the TOE which was introduced during its development,
      e.g. defeating the TSF self protection through tampering, direct
      attack or monitoring of the TSF, defeating the TSF domain
      separation through monitoring or direct attack the TSF, or
      defeating non-bypassability through circumventing (bypassing)
      the TSF.  Operational vulnerabilities take advantage of
      weaknesses in non-technical countermeasures to violate the TOE
      SFRs, e.g. misuse or incorrect configuration. Misuse
      investigates whether the TOE can be configured or used in a
      manner that is insecure, but that an administrator or user of
      the TOE would reasonably believe to be secure.</para>
      <para type="normal">
        Assessment of development vulnerabilities is covered by the
        assurance family <xref id="ava_van" show="id"/>. Basically,
        all development vulnerabilities can be considered in the
        context of <xref id="ava_van" show="id"/> due to the fact,
        that this family allows application of a wide range of
        assessment methodologies being unspecific to the kind of an
        attack scenario. These unspecific assessment methodologies
        comprise, among other, also the specific methodologies for
        those TSF where covert channels are to be considered (a
        channel capacity estimation can be done using informal
        engineering measurements, as well as actual test measurements)
        or can be overcome by the use of sufficient resources in the
        form of a direct attack (underlying technical concept of those
        TSF is based on probabilistic or permutational mechanisms; a
        qualification of their security behaviour and the effort
        required to overcome them can be made using a quantitative or
        statistical analysis).</para>

      If there are security objectives specified in the ST to either
      to prevent one user of the TOE from observing activity

      information flows cannot be used to achieve enforced illicit
      data signals, covert channel analysis should be considered
      during the conduct of the vulnerability analysis.  This is often
      reflected by the inclusion of <xref id="fpr_uno" show="link"/>

        The purpose of the vulnerability assessment activity is to

          whether any of the SFRs can be undermined through unexpected

              vulnerabilities (as detailed in <xref id="ava_van.4-3" show="id"/>), testing should be performed to confirm the

            The analysis of the guidance documentation is to include
            consideration of whether it is possible to unknowingly
            configure the TOE insecurely. Therefore, the analysis will
            consider warning prompts provided by the TOE when
            configuration options are selected by the user that may
            render the TOE in an insecure state, not just in the
            guidance but also in the use of the TOE. An example may be
            when access control rules are amended from a remote
            administration console, which will not take effect until
            the TOE has been restarted.  The evaluator will determine
            whether the TOE issues a suitable warning when the changes
