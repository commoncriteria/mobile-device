  <ns1:Introduction>
    <ns0:section id="overview" title="Overview"> The scope of the MDM Agent PP-Module is to describe the security functionality of a Mobile Device Management (MDM) Agent in terms of [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PPs: <html:ul>
        <html:li>Mobile Device Management (MDM) Protection Profile, Version 4.0</html:li>
        <html:li>Mobile Device Fundamentals (MDF) Protection Profile, Version 3.1</html:li>
      </html:ul>
      <html:br /> These Base-PPs are valid because a MDM Agent is
      either a 3rd party application manufactured by the MDM Server vendor or is a
      native application deployed on a mobile device. </ns0:section>

    <ns0:section id="targets" title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation"> 
      The MDM system
      consists of two primary components: the MDM Server software and the MDM Agent. This PP-Module specifically addresses the MDM Agent. The MDM Agent establishes a secure connection back
      to the MDM Server, from which it receives policies to enforce on the mobile
      device. Optionally, the MDM Agent interacts with the Mobile Application
      Store (MAS) Server to download and install enterprise-hosted applications.<html:br /><html:br /> A
      compliant MDM Agent is installed on a mobile device as an application
      (supplied by the developer of the MDM Server software) or is part of the
      mobile device's OS.This PP-Module builds on either the MDF PP or the MDM PP. A TOE
      that claims conformance to this PP-Module must also claim conformance to one
      of those PPs as its Base-PP. A compliant TOE is obligated
      to implement the functionality required in the Base-PP along with the
      additional functionality defined in this PP-Module in order to mitigate the
      threats that are defined by this PP-Module.<html:br /><html:br /> This PP-Module shall build on the MDF PP if the TOE is a native part of a mobile operating system. The TOE for
      this PP-Module combined with the MDF PP is the mobile
      device itself plus the MDM Agent. If the MDM Agent is part
      of the mobile device’s OS, the MDM Agent may present multiple interfaces for
      configuring the mobile device, such as a local interface and a remote interface. Agents
      conforming to this PP-Module must at least offer an interface with a trusted
      channel that serves as one piece of an MDM system. Conformant MDM Agents may also offer other interfaces, and the configuration aspects of
      these additional interfaces are in scope of this .<html:br /><html:br />
      This PP-Module shall build on the MDM Server PP if the TOE is a third-party application that is provided with
      an MDM Server and installed on a mobile device by the user after acquiring
      the mobile device. The distributed TOE for this PP-Module
      combined with the MDM Server PP is the entire MDM environment, which includes both the MDM Server and the
        MDM Agent. Even though the mobile device itself is not part of the TOE, it is expected to be evaluated against the MDF PP so that
	its baseline security capabilities can be assumed to be present.

	<ns1:TOE_Boundary> Figure 1 shows a high-level example of the PP-Module
        TOE boundary and its Operational Environment. As stated above, the MDM Agent may either be provided as part of the mobile device itself (shown in
        red) or distributed as a third-party application from the developer of the MDM Server software (shown in blue).<html:br /><html:br />
        <ns0:figure entity="images/MDMagentoperatingenvironment.jpg" title="MDM Agent Operating Environment" id="toe" /><html:br /> The MDM
        Agent must closely interact with or be part of the mobile device’s platform in order to
        establish policies and to perform queries about device status. The mobile device, in turn,
        has its own security requirements specified in the MDF PP. </ns1:TOE_Boundary>
    </ns0:section>
    <ns1:Use_Cases> This PP-Module defines 4 use cases:<html:br /><html:br />
      <ns0:usecases>
        <ns0:usecase title="Enterprise-owned device for general-purpose enterprise use" id="usecase1">
          <ns0:description> An Enterprise-owned device for general-purpose business use is commonly
            called Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE). This use case entails a significant
            degree of Enterprise control over configuration and software inventory. Enterprise
            administrators use an MDM product to establish policies on the mobile
            devices prior to user issuance. Users may use Internet connectivity to browse the web or
            access corporate mail or run Enterprise applications, but this connectivity may be under
            significant control of the Enterprise. The user may also be expected to store data and
            use applications for personal, non-enterprise use. The Enterprise administrator uses the
              MDM product to deploy security policies and query mobile device
            status. The MDM may issue commands for remediation actions.
          </ns0:description>
        </ns0:usecase>
        <ns0:usecase title="Enterprise-owned device for specialized, high-security use" id="usecase2">
          <ns0:description>An Enterprise-owned device with intentionally limited network connectivity,
            tightly controlled configuration, and limited software inventory is appropriate for
            specialized, high-security use cases. As in the previous use case, the MDM product is used to establish such policies on mobile devices prior to
            issuance to users. The device may not be permitted connectivity to any external
            peripherals. It may only be able to communicate via its Wi-Fi or cellular radios with
            the Enterprise-run network, which may not even permit connectivity to the Internet. Use
            of the device may require compliance with usage policies that are more restrictive than
            those in any general-purpose use case, yet may mitigate risks to highly sensitive
            information. Based upon the operation environment and the acceptable risk level of the
            enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in <ns0:xref to="sfr" />
            of this Protection Profile along with the selections in the Use Case 2 template defined
            in <ns0:xref to="usecase1" /> are sufficient for the high-security use case.

	</ns0:usecase>
        <ns0:usecase title="Personally owned device for personal and enterprise use" id="usecase3">
          <ns0:description>A personally owned device, which is used, for both personal activities and
            enterprise data is commonly called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). The device may be
            provisioned for access to enterprise resources after significant personal usage has
            occurred. Unlike in the enterprise-owned cases, the enterprise is limited in what
            security policies it can enforce because the user purchased the device primarily for
            personal use and is unlikely to accept policies that limit the functionality of the
            device.<html:br /><html:br /> However, because the Enterprise allows the user full (or
            nearly full) access to the Enterprise network, the Enterprise will require certain
            security policies, for example a password or screen lock policy, and health reporting,
            such as the integrity of the mobile device system software, before allowing access. The
            administrator of the MDM can establish remediation actions, such as
            wipe of the Enterprise data, for non-compliant devices. These controls could potentially
            be enforced by a separation mechanism built-in to the device itself to distinguish
            between enterprise and personal activities, or by a third-party application that
            provides access to enterprise resources and leverages security capabilities provided by
            the mobile device. Based upon the Operational Environment and the acceptable risk level
            of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in <ns0:xref to="sfr" /> of this Protection Profile along with the selections in the Use Case 3
            template defined in <ns0:xref to="use-case" /> are sufficient for the secure
          implementation of this BYOD use case.</ns0:description>

        <ns0:usecase title="Personally owned device for personal and limited enterprise use" id="usecase4">
          <ns0:description>A personally owned device may also be given access to limited enterprise
            services such as enterprise email. Because the user does not have full access to the
            enterprise or enterprise data, the enterprise may not need to enforce any security
            policies on the device. However, the enterprise may want secure email and web browsing
            with assurance that the services being provided to those clients by the mobile device
            are not compromised. Based upon the Operational Environment and the acceptable risk
            level of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in <ns0:xref to="sfr" /> of this PP are sufficient for the secure

                detects modification of the channel data.</ns0:title>
              <ns0:note role="application"> The intent of this requirement is to protect the
                communications channel between MDM Server and Agent, post

                channel between MDM Server and Agent during enrollment.
                <html:br /><html:br /> This requirement is to ensure that the transmission of any audit
                logs, mobile device information data (software version, hardware model, and
                application versions), and configuration data collected by the MDM
                Agent and sent from the MDM Agent to the MDM
                Server, when commanded, or at configurable intervals, is properly protected. This
                trusted channel also protects any commands and policies sent by the MDM Server to the MDM Agent. Either the MDM Agent or the MDM Server is able to initiate the
                connection.<html:br /><html:br /> This requirement is iterated from the MDF PP to indicate the protocols that the MDM Agent can use for a trusted
                channel. The mobile device is required to perform the mandated cryptographic
                protocols as in the Base-PP for communication channels mandated in
                the MDF PP. The ST author must select one of
                TLS, DTLS, or HTTPS in order to establish and maintain a trusted channel between the
                  MDM Agent and the MDM Server. Only TLS, DTLS,
                or HTTPS are acceptable for this trusted channel.<html:br /><html:br /> Since this
                requirement is only for the case when the PP-Module builds on MDF
                PP and in this case it is expected that the MDM Agent will be a
                native part of the mobile operating system, it is expected that the MDM Agent will utilize the mobile device's implementation of the
                selected protocols. HTTPS (FCS_HTTPS_EXT.1) and TLS (FCS_TLSC_EXT.1) are already

            <ns0:note role="application"> The trusted channel is defined in FPT_ITT.1(2) of the Base-PP if Agent extends MDM Server and FTP_ITC_EXT.1 if Agent extends MDF PP. “Alert” in this requirement could be as simple as an audit record or
              a notification. If any prior alerts exist in the queue, per FAU_ALT_EXT.2.2, those
              alerts must be sent when the trusted channel is available.<html:br /><html:br /> This
              requirement is to ensure that the MDM Agent must notify the MDM Server whenever one of the events listed above occurs. Lack of
              receipt of a successful policy installation indicates the failure of the policy
              installation.<html:br /><html:br /> The periodic reachability events ensure that either
              the MDM Agent responds to MDM Server polls to
              determine device network reachability, or the MDM Agent can be
              configured to regularly notify the Server that it is reachable. The ST author must select “receiving” in the first case and “generating” in the second.
              The corresponding requirement for the MDM Server is FAU_NET_EXT.1 in
              the MDM
              PP.<html:br /><html:br /> The ST author must either
              assign further events or select the “no other events” option. Note that alerts may
              take time to reach the MDM Server, or not arrive, due to poor
