Because Presentation Attack Detection ([PAD](#abbr_PAD)) is an			      <

cost-effective nor feasible to create a complete list of attack vectors		      <

[CC](#abbr_CC) evaluations. Such a list would be ever-changing, and		      <
unlike code vulnerabilities (i.e. CVEs), the equipment, skill, time, and	      <
cost required to test highly sophisticated attacks is highly infeasible		      <
for a testing lab given the current timeframe for [CC](#abbr_CC)		      <

by researchers for years.\							      <

presentation attacks and the appropriate pen-testing (for example, red		      <
teaming and blue teaming) performed as proof.\					      <

To be specific, basic attacks (including basic and enhanced-basic		      <
[\[IBPC\]](#IBPC)) refer to attacks in literature of low skill that can		      <
be performed on a limited budget. This includes, but is not limited to,		      <
playback attacks of a spoken utterance using a different mobile device		      <
for voice authentication, taking a photograph of a fingerprint or facial	      <
and submitting it to the sensor, among other examples.\				      <
\										      <
Intermediate (or moderate [\[IBPC\]](#IBPC)) attacks can include, but		      <
are not limited to, creating a foam finger to thwart fingerprint		      <
detection and using a higher quality playback device to thwart liveness		      <
detection.\									      <
\										      <
Advanced (including high and beyond high [\[IBPC\]](#IBPC)) attacks can		      <
include, but are not limited to, creating a synthetic hand with the		      <
given fingerprint using an expensive 3D-printer and forcing someone to		      <
reveal one's credentials through coercion or threats that may cause harm	      <
(where detection of duress is required). Many of these attack techniques	      <
may be sensitive or government classified. ]{.note}				      <

attempts used for access to a single session on the device.\			      <
\										      <
Accessing a single session may involve a single authentication factor,		      <
in which case the SAFAR for a single attempt will be equal to the false		      <
accept rate ([FAR](#abbr_FAR)) of that authentication factor and the		      <
SAFAR for n attempts will be \$1-\\left(1-FAR\\right)\^n\$, assuming		      <
independence.\									      <
\										      <
Accessing a single session on the device may involve the ability to use		      <
multiple authentication factors. It may be the case that only one		      <
authentication factor is needed to access a single session on the device	      <
(i.e. both a password and a [BAF](#abbr_BAF) can be used, but only one		      <
is needed) or that both authentication factors are needed to access a		      <
single session on the device (i.e. both the [BAF](#abbr_BAF) and a PIN		      <
must be entered). The full equations for calculating the SAFAR can be		      <
found in [Section G.3 SAFAR Calculation						      <
Equations](#biometric3){.dynref}. A fully worked-out example that		      <
applies the equations in [Section G.3 SAFAR Calculation				      <
Equations](#biometric3){.dynref} for calculating the SAFAR can be found		      <
in [Section G.4 SAFAR Calculation Example](#biometric4){.dynref}.\		      <
\										      <
The worst-case scenario must be used to calculate the SAFAR. Thus the		      <
authentication factor with the highest [FAR](#abbr_FAR) must be used for	      <
the maximum number of authentication attempts allowed for that factor.		      <
If any authentication attempts remain, then the authentication factor		      <
with the second highest [FAR](#abbr_FAR) is used for the maximum number		      <
of authentication attempts allowed for that factor and so on. For		      <
example, the [TOE](#abbr_TOE) supports a password and a				      <
[BAF](#abbr_BAF), the [FAR](#abbr_FAR) for the [BAF](#abbr_BAF) is		      <
higher than the [FAR](#abbr_FAR) for the password and each			      <
authentication factor utilizes a shared counter per				      <
[FIA\_AFL\_EXT.1](#FIA_AFL_EXT.1). Then the worst-case scenario is the		      <
[BAF](#abbr_BAF) is utilized for the maximum number of authentication		      <
attempts allowed for the [BAF](#abbr_BAF). For any remaining			      <
authentication attempts allowed the password is utilized.\			      <
\										      <
Another example is the [TOE](#abbr_TOE) supports a password and two		      <
BAFs, where the BAFs have different FARs, with both FARs being higher		      <
than the password [FAR](#abbr_FAR). Then the worst-case scenario is that	      <
the [BAF](#abbr_BAF) with the highest [FAR](#abbr_FAR) is used for the		      <
maximum number of authentication attempts allowed for that			      <
[BAF](#abbr_BAF), followed by the second [BAF](#abbr_BAF) if any		      <
authentication attempts are allowed for that [BAF](#abbr_BAF). If any		      <
authentication attempts remain, then the password is utilized for those		      <
attempts.\									      <
\										      <
The 1% margin is included for cases where a [BAF](#abbr_BAF) is not a		      <
critical authentication factor and thus both [BAF](#abbr_BAF) and		      <
password can be used in a session without exceeding the declared SAFAR.\	      <

										      <
The following use case templates list those selections, assignments, and	      <
objective requirements that best support the use cases identified by		      <
this Protection Profile. Note that the templates assume that all SFRs		      <
listed in [Section 5.1 Security Functional Requirements](#sfr){.dynref}		      <
are included in the [ST](#abbr_ST), not just those listed in the		      <
templates. These templates and deviations from the template should be		      <
identified in the Security Target to assist customers with making		      <
risk-based purchasing decisions. Products that do not meet these		      <
templates are not precluded from use in the scenarios identified by this	      <
Protection Profile.\								      <
\										      <
Several of the use cases templates include objective requirements that		      <
are strongly desired for the indicated use cases. Readers can expect		      <
those requirements to be made mandatory in a future revision of this		      <
protection profile, and industry should aim to include that security		      <
functionality in products in the near-term.\					      <
\										      <
Where selections for a particular requirement are not identified in a		      <
use case template, all available selections are equally applicable to		      <
the use case.									      <

For the purposes of this [PP](#abbr_PP),					      |	::: {.uc_from_fel}
[FIA\_BMG\_EXT.1](#FIA_BMG_EXT.1) requires testing for [FAR](#abbr_FAR),	      |	From [FCS\_STG\_EXT.1.2](#FCS_STG_EXT.1.2):
[FRR](#abbr_FRR) and SAFAR if a [BAF](#abbr_BAF) is included in the		      |	:::
[TOE](#abbr_TOE). In this version of the [PP](#abbr_PP) it is expected		      <
that the vendor will provide evidence to the evaluator of the testing		      <
completed to support the claimed [FAR](#abbr_FAR) and [FRR](#abbr_FRR).		      <
This Appendix provides a guide to how this testing could be done and to		      <
what error bars are expected when the Rule of 3 is applied. This guide		      <
should be treated as a reference and not as a NIAP mandate, requirement,	      <
or set of mandates or requirements.\						      <
\										      <
										      <
#### G.1.2 Testing environment that could meet FIA\_BMG\_EXT.1.1 {#sub2 .indexable da <
										      <
In performing tests for [FAR](#abbr_FAR) and [FRR](#abbr_FRR), ISO/IEC		      <
19795-1 recommends that vendors or testing labs use the largest test		      <
population that can be reasonably managed. Generally, testing			      <
environments for mobile devices are based upon individual devices with		      <
their own local authentication templates/profiles where the submitted		      <
biometric samples are destroyed after submission. It is infeasible to		      <
meet the given timeframe for [CC](#abbr_CC) evaluations of mobile		      <
devices if offline testing is not supported. Either online or offline		      <
testing is acceptable. The number of test subjects needed to support a		      <
claimed [FAR](#abbr_FAR) and [FRR](#abbr_FRR), will depend on if online		      <
or offline testing is used due to how the subjects are compared.\		      <
\										      <
If online testing is utilized, it is expected that the testing is		      <
conducted directly on the [TOE](#abbr_TOE). The legitimate user will		      <
enroll on the [TOE](#abbr_TOE) and all test subjects will be compared to	      <
only the legitimate user. Thus if the target [FAR](#abbr_FAR) is 1:100,		      <
at least 300 independent samples shall be used corresponding to 300		      <
users and at least 300 independent trials are required in testing this		      <
[FAR](#abbr_FAR). It is acceptable that multiple TOEs, each with a		      <
different legitimate user, could be used to reduce the number of test		      <
subjects needed for online testing. With the assumption that the test		      <
subjects are compared against all legitimate users and no legitimate		      <
users are counted as test subjects, if *N~D~* devices are used, the		      <
number of test subjects needed can be divided by *N~D~*.\			      <
\										      <
If offline testing is used, it is expected that the biometric system		      <
used for testing will not be in the evaluated configuration of the		      <
[TOE](#abbr_TOE) to allow for a full cross-comparison, in which the		      <
biometric sample from the test subjects is compared with every non-self		      <
template. It is expected, that the biometric system used for testing		      <
will collect samples and generate templates exactly the same as the		      <
biometric system in the [TOE](#abbr_TOE). However, even though the		      <
comparison to determine if a valid sample is provided (i.e. matching		      <
algorithm) should remain the same, it is acceptable if the biometric		      <
system is modified to complete a full cross-comparison. Per ISO/IEC		      <
19795, these comparisons will not be statistically independent, but this	      <
approach is statistically unbiased. Additionally, offline testing with a	      <
full cross-comparison greatly reduces the number of test subjects		      <
needed. If there are *N~U~* users, the number of available individual		      <
independent comparisons will be *N~U~\*(N~U~-1)/2*. Thus if the target		      <
[FAR](#abbr_FAR) is 1:10000, only 246 test subjects are needed if		      <
offline testing of a full cross-comparison is used.\				      <
\										      <
										      <
#### G.1.3 Deriving False Accept Rate {#sub3 .indexable data-level="3"}		      <
										      <
To expedite approval while maintaining a statistically valid result, it		      <
is required for the vendor or independent lab to perform testing using		      <
*three* times the sample size, at a minimum, i.e. the \"Rule of 3\" for		      <
the number of trials.\								      <
\										      <
Three times the sample size corresponds to 90% confidence and *c* = 0.95	      <
(rounded, worst-case), where *c* is a percentage/fraction of the		      <
intended false error rate (either [FAR](#abbr_FAR) or [FRR](#abbr_FRR))		      <
for which the error bar is calculated.\						      <
\										      <
The parameters associated with the Rule of 3 are derived by treating a		      <
biometric test, consisting of many comparisons, as a series of Bernoulli	      <
trials.\									      <
\										      <
As shown in the tables below, the error bar may be large if a higher		      <
false error rate is declared.\							      <
\										      <
The table below assumes online testing using a single device, thus a		      <
single legitimate user.\							      <

that is widely used is the standard Wald interval, expressed in Equation	      <
(1) as:\									      <
\										      <
\$\$\\left(p-z\_{α/2}√\\frac{p\\left(1-p\\right)}{n}\\right)≤I\_{conf}≤		      <

\										      <
where *p = X/n* is the sample proportion of successes (or error in this		      <
case), *z~α/2~* is the 100(1 -- α/2)th percentile of the standard normal	      <
distribution, and *n* is the number of trials.\					      <
\										      <
Although intervals such as the Wilson, Agresti-Coull, and Jeffreys		      <
intervals are recommended by Brown et al., biometrics testing in		      <
practice rests on the derivation of the Rule of 30 based on the Wald		      <
distribution [\[BROWN\]](#Brown). However, because of the large sample		      <
size, number of test subjects, and number of trials required for the		      <
Rule of 30, this [PP](#abbr_PP) mandates the Rule of 3 to make testing		      <
more feasible.\									      <
\										      <
In simpler form, this refers to a confidence interval with error *E*		      <
expressed as:\									      <
\										      <
\$\$E=z\_{α/2}√\\frac{p\\left(1-p\\right)}{n}\\quad\\quad(2)\$\$\		      <
\										      <
Rearranging the equation to express the number of trials, *n*, in terms		      <
of error *E*, this expression becomes:\						      <
\										      <
\$\$n=\\left(\\frac{z\_{α/2}}{E}\\right)\^2p\\left(1-p\\right)\\quad\\quad(3)\$\$\    <
\										      <
In practice, *E* is expressed as a proportion of the error probability		      <
as:\										      <
\										      <
\$\$E = cp\\quad\\quad(4)\$\$\							      <
\										      <
Thus, *n* finally becomes:\							      <
\										      <
\$\$n=\\left(\\frac{z\_{α/2}}{c}\\right)\^2\\frac{\\left(1-p\\right)}{p}\\quad\\quad( <
\										      <
For a 90% confidence interval, *z~α/2~* = 1.6449, while for a 95%		      <
confidence interval, *z~α/2~* = 1.96.\						      <
\										      <
Thus it is easy to see that for a 90% confidence interval with *c* =		      <
0.95:\										      <
\										      <
\$\$\\left ( \\frac{1.6449}{0.95}\\right )\^{2}= 2.998 ≈			      <

										      >	Include [FPT\_BBD\_EXT.1](#FPT_BBD_EXT.1) in the [ST](#abbr_ST)
										      >	:::

A number of equations can be used in calculating SAFAR. A fully-worked		      |	::: {.uc_inc_fcomp}
example that applies the equations below can be found in [Section G.4		      |	Include [FPT\_TST\_EXT.2/POSTKERNEL](#FPT_TST_EXT.2/POSTKERNEL) in
SAFAR Calculation Example](#biometric4){.dynref}.\				      |	[ST](#abbr_ST).
\										      |	:::
The SAFAR for a single authentication factor is calculated as			      <
\$SAFAR=1-\\left(1-FAR\\right)\^{attempts allowed}\$.\				      <
\										      <
Thus let *SAFAR~i~* be the SAFAR for the *i^th^* authentication factor		      <
where *n~i~* is the number of authentication attempts allowed for the		      <
given factor, treated individually as a separate authentication system,		      <
which can be expressed as\							      <
\										      <
\$\$SAFAR\_i=1-\\left(1-FAR\_i\\right)\^{ni},\\quad\\quad (1)\$\$\		      <
\										      <
assuming each attempt is independent.\						      <
\										      <
If multiple authentication factors are required (with all to pass), i.e.	      <
password plus biometric factor, the SAFAR for a single attempt will be		      <
the product of each individual factor's false accept rate, assuming each	      <
attempt is independent.\							      <
\										      <
Thus, for a hybrid combination of *m* PIN/password and biometric factors	      <
(denoted with index *j*) with *n~i~* attempts allowed, treated			      <
collectively as an individual authentication factor in a separate		      <
authentication system, the SAFAR can be expressed as:\				      <
\										      <
\$\$SAFAR\_i=1-\\left(1-∏\^m\_{j=1}FAR\_j\\right)\^{ni},\\quad\\quad		      <
(2)\$\$\									      <
assuming each attempt is independent. Because this is currently			      <
associated with a PIN/password and biometrics, *m* = 2 in this case.\		      <
\										      <
When ordered, let *SAFAR~(k)~* be the SAFAR for the authentication		      <
factor with the largest SAFAR, and *SAFAR~(1)~* be the SAFAR for the		      <
authentication factor with the smallest SAFAR, i.e. *SAFAR~(1)~* ≤		      <
*SAFAR~(s)~* ≤ ... ≤ *SAFAR~(k-1)~* ≤ *SAFAR~(k)~*.\				      <
\										      <
As such, the following equations for SAFAR utilizing multiple factors		      <
follow (using the worst SAFARs):\						      <
\										      <
If the user has a choice of multiple authentication factors with a		      <
choice of only one authentication factor in a given session (i.e. all		      <
authentication factors are considered critical and a user cannot switch		      <
between authentication factors), the overall SAFAR will be equal to		      <
*SAFAR~(k)~*, assuming each attempt is independent.\				      <
\										      <
If the user has a choice of multiple authentication factors and can		      <
choose to attempt authentication using more than one factor with success	      <
requiring any factor to pass and *n~i~* attempts allowed per factor) for	      <
a given session, the SAFAR for *k* available authentication factors will	      <
be\										      <
\										      <
\$\$SAFAR\_{any}=1-∏\^k\_{i=1}\\left(1-SAFAR\_i\\right)\\quad\\quad		      <
(3)\$\$\									      <
assuming each attempt is independent. If there are *critical factors*,		      <
the highest SAFAR corresponding to the *worst-case* set of choices shall	      <
be reported.\									      <
\										      <
If the user has the choice of a number of authentication factors from		      <
which the user must choose *m* factors, all of which must pass with *n*		      <
attempts per factor allowed, the SAFAR for a single combination of *m*		      <
factors will be\								      <
\										      <
\$\$SAFAR\_{m factors}=∏\^m\_{i=1}\\left(SAFAR\_i\\right)\\quad\\quad		      <
(4)\$\$\									      <
\										      <
assuming each attempt is independent. If *m \< k* available factors, the	      <
worst-case of all \$\\left(\^k\_m\\right)\$ combinations of factors		      <
becomes the overall SAFAR.							      <

    \										      <
    Since the SAFAR for password with ten attempts allowed is known, it		      <

    The risk of providing authentication feedback is that if either		      <
